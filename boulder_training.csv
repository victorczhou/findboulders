Fire on the Mountain,1,slab,face,Start on an obvious patina flake and pull through powerful first moves. Climb through crimps to the slab top out.
All hands on deck,0,slab,crack,Take the traversing rail to get established for the the perfect hands section.  Enjoy those hands as they leave you high and dry and wishing you had a possible pad or spotter.  Should clean up nice.
Eons of Van Dikes,1,slab,face,Follow the dike that carries you up to a sweet set of indents up high.  Minor rollerballs up high but they should clean up over time.
Perry's Pose,3,slab,technical,A superb sloper arete climb. Sit start on the leftside of the angled arete with a couple good footholds and hands on the arete. Climb the arete rightwards using heel hooks and smears until you get your hands on a small seam. There is a small good cobble/ feature a little higher from the seam. Grab it and mantel over. Finish up the slab to the top of the boulder and take a deep breath of fresh airband enjoy the view!
To Kill Ya Corner,3,overhanging,technical,Start high on the triangular block.  Press out a technical high-step with a crimp to reach the large positive edge.  Finish on jugs up high.
Grommit,4,overhanging,technical,"Sustained, technical sidepulling along a continuous feature with a high crux makes this one of the best of its grade at the Milks. Follow the right-trending weakness to a hard move reaching out right and shooting to the lip."
Seven Spanish Angels (aka The Ruckus),6,overhanging,dyno,A must do!  One of the best in Bishop.  Climb the knobs and dyno for the tea-cup hueco at the lip.
Get Carter,7,overhanging,steep,A much traveled classic.      Sit-start and slap up slopers following the striking black streak on the north-west side of the boulder.    Requires compression and core strength for the grade.
Unnamed,7,overhanging,traverse,"Start on 'Grommit', left of 'Seven Spanish Angels' and traverse right to finish on 'Seven Spanish Angels'... great!"
Flecheros,8,vertical,technical,"Slightly less obvious but really cool. Start on To Kill Ya Corner Sit and climb straight up, using a small nubbly for the left and perhaps a large loaf pinch for the right. Make your way up and slightly left with good technique, way up to the top. Dimitri and I did this thing on an amazing sunny and snowy day. After poodling off the top numerous times we dragged the mattress out of my van, hit the stainless bong a few times, and both floated to the top through rainbow snow flurries. Dimitri later lapped this thing in his Huarache sandals. It’s all technique!"
Michael Caine,9,overhanging,steep,Start standing with the left hand on a high gaston in the right-hand seam.  Pull on and make a long shouldery move right to join with the top of 'Get Carter'.
Twin Cracks,9,overhanging,steep,"Stand start with a left hand in a good/sharp crack slot, right hand in the other crack system. Make a couple moves to more sharp crimps, sidepulls, and/or slopers. Top out left on good holds. Probably easier for taller folks, could be harder for the short."
A Scanner Darkly,12,overhanging,steep,Sit start with your right hand in the crack and your left on the dogbone pinch. Throw left hand up and make a tricky foot swap. From here make a wild throw with the right hand to a sloping edge (crux) and continue up the two cracks and finish as for Twin Cracks. A very hard sustained line that is sure to be a classic. A must do if you climb the grade.
Checkerboard,7,overhanging,face,"Start at a prominant incut flake (not the jug rail just to the right) a bit left of center on the tall, slightly overhanging NW face of the 'Checkerboard Boulder'.  Climb up and right to an exciting last move high off the deck.  An excellent problem!"
King Me,10,overhanging,technical,A very difficult and rarely climbed line. Sit start on the right side of the rock below the arete with the right hand on a juicy pinch and the left hand on the sloping edge. Pull on making some difficult compression moves and climb up and rightward.   Stand start at v3 utilizing the deep slot.
"No Sense, No Reason",4,vertical,face,A fun climb that finishes on good patina flakes.    Sit start at a sidepull and a good crimp for the right hand.    Make a few hard pulls to gain the lip and then bust a move up and right to the smooth patina of the beautiful quartz monzonite.    Top out more easily.   The best way down is down the patina.
Spectre,13,overhanging,steep,"This is a classic testpiece that was established by Dave Graham.  I found this to be one of the most striking lines in Bishop-- it climbs directly out of a steep roof on just a few well-spaced holds.    At first glance it honestly doesn't look as hard as some other problems of the grade.  'The Buttermilker' for instance, seems like a much more improbable line than 'The Spectre'.  Once you pull off the ground though, the magnitude of the moves hits you.  The tension required to keep your feet on is extreme, the moves are long, and the difficulty is unrelenting despite its relatively short length.    At 6'1"" I found the opening move to be quite doable, and as with most people the real business starts with the toehook and match before setting up for the big next move.    If you're climbing at this grade then you already know about this problem.  It is a significant landmark in Bishop's bouldering landscape and every ascent of it is certainly well-earned."
Beekeeping for Profit & Pleasure,4,overhanging,steep,"Steep jug-hauling down low to fun and exciting moves around the bulge.    Sit-start down at the lowest two huecos and make a move up and left to a huge jug.  Follow the jugs and good edges out to the jug flake.  Rest here, then bust up thru the crux with crimps and sidepulls to the huge flake with a jug at the top.  Downclimb/drop off here or continue out up and right to the top of the boulder at 30+ feet!"
The Beekeeper's Apprentice,5,overhanging,steep,The Beekeeper's Apprentice follows the same line as the Beekeeper but finishes at the hueco jugs just after the crux crimps.
Essential Peabody,0,overhanging,steep,"Go more or less straight up many huecos to a hole and finish up the slab to the summit, or downclimb."
Left Nixon Crack,0,overhanging,crack,A beautiful hands/off-hands crack on a vertical face with a small overhang at the top.
The Beekeeper,6,overhanging,steep,"This beast of a boulder problem packs the punch of a route - close to 40 feet, but due to all the climbing under the roof and the slope of the ground your feet will only tickle the 20 foot-mark near the top.  Before you jump on the upper section, be sure to realize the seriousness of the down-climb, which is down the northeast face/arete.      Start way down on the left side of the roof in the huecos.  Move out the roof sightly right using fins and huecos to a large hueco with a jug on the right side, just before the lip of the roof.  Bust out right into the crux using sharp crimps and good footwork to the big move up to the large sidepull/jug.  Follow the path of jugs and big moves up and right all the way to the top.    Downclimb the northeast face.  (be careful!)"
Mesothelioma,7,overhanging,face,The crux is up high on this route.  No move is really harder than V4-5 but the pump might get you at the end as you search desperately for holds.    SDS is a V8.
Golden Shower,10,overhanging,technical,There are two cruxes on Golden Shower.  The first is down low and the second is up high.  The rock is a bit sharp (especially one left hand crimp on the arete) and the landing is a bit jagged so bring lots of pads and friends.  One of the proudest lines in Bishop.    Beta:  (let's see if I can remember this right)  begin in the shallow hueco and move up to a good edge with the right hand.  Then shift feet and bust out left to the arete and get a decent sloper.  Shift feet and bump up to the aforementioned sharp arete hold.  Move your left foot to the corner of the arete and right foot almost by your right hand and do the crux move to a right hand sidepull.  Move feet up and bump left hand to a pinch.  Heel hook left foot by your hand and do a big move to a good patine hold.  Get matched up on the rail and move right on worsening patina and heel hook the aforementioned good patina.  Reach up and get a sloper until you can bump over and get a crimp (upper crux)  Rock over and grab the tear drop (or it is tea cup) jug.  Whew.
Jedi Mind Tricks,4,vertical,face,"Must do for anyone in the Pollen Grains.  The crux is right off the ground with very poor feet.  Once you are high enough to use the flake with your feet it is smooth sailing to the very last move, which is the mental crux.  A creaky flake (it is solid, trust it) for your left and a grainy side-pull for your right set you up for the grab for the lip.  Just amazing!"
Return Jedi,10,vertical,technical,"A nice thin technical line up the arete just left of Jedi Mind Tricks. Begin on right-facing crimps and move up and right on small holds. Once you unlock this low percentage crux, move back left to the arete for a stimulating finish on easy but questionable holds. This line should clean up nicely with more traffic. Worth the effort!"
Original Line,0,vertical,traverse,"Just right of Snake Oil, this line follows jugs straight up to the highest lip, then traverses left and up more big plates.  Generally used as the downclimb for other routes that top out the Lidija boulder."
Lidija's Mouth,3,slab,technical,"On the north side of the Lidija Boulder lies a massive mouth. Moving left to right will allow you do reach out of the lip and grab a slopey dish. From here, pull onto the slab and top 'er out"
Suspended in Silence,5,overhanging,technical,Start on 1 of 2 big flakes at head height.  Crux is the first move up to a smallish crimp. Stick this and screw up the courage for the long haul to the top. Reachy moves between small sidepulls and gastons leads you straight up and over the bulge (at about 30 feet).  Scary!!
Drone Militia,6,vertical,face,This is one heck of a highball. Climb the middle of the SW face. The crux is at a reasonable height and the holds just get bigger the higher you climb.
Cover Me With Flowers,2,vertical,face,Classic V2!  Follow the rightward leaning crack on good crimps and incuts to a slopey bucket at the lip.  Worth a stop before heading down to Jedi Mind Tricks.
Cindy Swank,7,vertical,face,Start standing on good holds about five feet up. Move up through a decent crimp to a big hold below the lip. Grab a good crimp on the lip then pull through some difficult moves to top out.
Swanky Sit,9,vertical,face,"Start sitting, matched down and left of Cindy Swank on the obvious left facing sidepull/pinch feature. Move right using small sidepulls and interesting movement until you are on Cindy Swank. Save some juice for the somewhat difficult moves pulling up and over the lip."
Finders Fee,9,overhanging,technical,"Start standing towards the right side of the overhanging west face on a good crimp rail. Move slightly left then up using small crimps and core tension. Once you hit the good hold on the lip, match and move right and up using a small crimp on the lip and a good hold that is hard to see from below.     One of the holds pulling up and over is a hollow flake that looks like it could break off, so be gentle..."
Vic's Demise,0,slab,face,"Yard on the hollow, see-through jug and move directly up the face on improving holds over a terrible landing to a top out 45 feet off the deck."
Bee Sneeze,3,slab,face,"Start low on two huecos, make tricky moves up and right until it is possible to make a scary roll up onto the slab."
Scooped Face,3,vertical,face,"Make some tricky moves off the ground, thru the overlap to reach the juggy huecos where you have a huge stance to rest on before clearing your head to climb the easy but airy top out."
The Ninth,7,overhanging,face,Stand start just left of the arete. Climb up on good holds and move right into the arete. A few big moves to good holds will get you to an easier top out. The crux is probably the hike up.
John Bachar Memorial Problem,1,slab,technical,A freeing highball warmup.  Start where the slab of White Slab meets the rock plate and begin up and right.  Near the curving arete commit to the crux to enjoy a pleasant and calm topout.   Originally named 'John Bachar Memorial Slab Problem' as a play on the JBMFP in J Tree.
Timothy Leary Presents...,2,vertical,face,The classic Hive problem.  Climb the obvious streak-hueco ladder then blindly reach to another hueco jug at the top to summit.  Sometimes done with a jump start from the small neighboring rock into the lowest long hueco.  Relatively poor and sloping landing.
North Face Direct,2,overhanging,steep,"This is right side of the awesome playground of giant huecos on the steep side of Grandma Peabody. Swing around on massive, perfect jugs until the boulder starts to roll back to slabby terrain, then downclimb or continue boldly to the top."
Go Granny Go,5,overhanging,steep,"This classic problem lies on the right side of the northwest face of Grandma Peabody. Sit start about eight feet left of the West Corner problem. Crimp up thin golden patina edges to some incut rails that lead up and right. From the end of the rails, move straight up to the crescent moon shaped hold above (either sidepull or gaston) and make a big reach up to jugs (crux). Continue up and right on big holds to a pair of jugs about eleven feet up (same finishing holds as the West Corner.) Drop off from here. It may be possible to top out by continuing ten more feet up the juggy rails, then rocking onto the grainy slab above. This finish may or may not have been done. (V? R/X)"
Go Granny Go  Right Finish (V5),5,overhanging,steep,"Sit start (same as Go Granny Go) at a good flake and climb up and right to good holds, and then further right to the arete. Continue up to the good incuts at about 10 feet. Climb down or drop off."
Magnetic North,8,overhanging,technical,"This has got to be one of the classiest lines in Bishop, climbing the pristine north face of the boulder. You could say it's contrived, but only because it's possible to go straight up the jugs to the left from the start. Once you're on the problem, it's as independent a line as any. This one starts on jugs to the left of Center Direct and traverses right via the 'finishing jug' of that problem to a series of edges and crimps midway up the wall. The crux is just high enough to get one's attention and involves a technical heel hook and a committing lock-off from a small crimp. The next few moves leading to the patina jugs are easier but still require some power. Tiptoe carefully up the slab above; you'll be soloing at this point. There are a couple of options. It's probably easiest starting a little further left from the uppermost patina, but you can more or less go straight up from where you finish the problem as well. Either way is a bit bold, but there are just enough positive smears to make it reasonable though insecure. Amazing! You can also climb into this line via Center Direct or, if you're really pulling hard, Direction."
Mystery,12,overhanging,traverse,Awesome line starting down and center on the face with the amphitheater. Sit start and traverse right on thin edges with some interesting footwork and link up with the top of Go Granny Ho. Super cool moves!
Direction,13,vertical,face,"Sit start the same as for Center Direct, instead of heading out left, head straight up to link up with The North Face."
Advanced Rockcraft Arete,0,slab,face,"For many, this is the perfect highball. Located on the iconic Grandpa Peabody Boulder, the physical crux is, for most, pulling onto Grandpa from a smaller boulder. The mental crux for many is the last pull over on to the top. After getting established on Grandpa, traverse right and then shoot up via immaculate crimps. Incredible!"
Footprints,9,slab,dyno,"Stand start at the lowest good holds. Climb up and left onto some sharp crimps / holds. Dyno to the big crumbling jug out left. Make a few more hard and reachy moves to get established onto the slab. Keep climbing up the slab to the top.Once you get established on the slab, the difficulty IMO is about 5.9ish. Most of the hands and feet are good, except for about 10-15 feet below the lip after a flake jug. The hands are slopey crimps and you have to stand up on less than ideal feet reaching for not so great hands. Fun.  Oh, don't fall."
Evilution to the Lip,10,overhanging,steep,"Stand start on the pile of rocks nd reach up high to a good left hand incut crimp and a flat and slopey right hand crimp. Pull onto the wall and fire off a big intro move. This is the crux move, so latch it good and pt on the game face. Move in lefty before going up right hand agin. Once here, continue moving up and leftwards on increasing sized holds. Once on the good sidepull flake continue up and traverse the lip rightwards utilizing a good right hand undercling. Grab a sloper jug then jump down onto a double stack of pads."
Ambrosia,11,overhanging,steep,"The stupid high gently overhanging face with the beautiful black streak on the Grandpa. Yeah so it's a boulder problem! V11 to the halfway point, then it supposedly eases up to V7 and then 5.12a    Enjoy!"
Evilution,12,overhanging,steep,"This landmark problem was first climbed by Jason Kehl, and stands as a North American classic.  At 55 feet, it is closer to a route than a boulder problem, and represents a new breed of boulder problems pushing the envelope of highball bouldering.  The initial face was first ascended by Chris Sharma around the same time that he did 'The Mandala'.  Originally, Chris simply dropped off from the lip holds at 20+ feet (most people down climb a bit before dropping).  The initial face features steep patina crimps on immaculate rock streaked with yellow lichen.  The drop-off problem is a classic in its own right and checks in at V9/10.    Jasons visionary line pulls the thin lip moves above the drop-off problem and continues onto an insecure 5.11 slab.  The upper crux is purportedly V9.  Since Jasons ascent, a variation has been established that takes are rightward exit that has easier moves, but on less than solid rock."
Lucid Dreaming,15,overhanging,dyno,"Sit-start to Rastaman Vibration. Start on a decent edge, move up to a shark tooth undercling/sidepull and a poor edge then make a big deadpoint to the start pinch on rastaman vibration and finish as for that problem. Extremely difficult"
Birthday Direct,3,vertical,technical,"Stand-start matched on a crimp and make a reach up to a high right-hand gaston.  Climb straight up with another gaston to a perfect jug on the lip.  Balancy, technical, and fun."
South Roof Crack,3,vertical,crack,"This is a roof crack formed by the two birthday boulders. Crawl in between them and sit start at a hand/hand stack or fist jams, depending on your hand size. Climb out towards the parking area, eventually getting established in a flaring chimney and continuing to the top."
Bard Route,6,vertical,face,"This is an engaging and worthwhile endeavor for those with thick skin. Begin with any combination of holds at head level. Don't worry, all of them are bad. With difficulty and a bit of luck, climb the face."
Right Nixon Crack,0,vertical,crack,"A nice tips crack leads to a wide slot, then sweet jams to the top of a vertical face."
Dripper,4,vertical,face,"Start all the way left on the Northwest Face, a few feet to the left to the start of Knobs. Head up the Arete before going back right to join up with the topout of the other climbs. Finish the topout line."
The Knobs,5,vertical,face,"Start at good crimps about 5 feet left of High Plains Drifter / Change of Heart. Make a couple moves straight up, then throw a right heel hook on the large knob feature and then rock over to make a long reach to gain a decent right hand hold. Harder if you're short."
Change of Heart,6,overhanging,face,"Some say it is harder the HPD some say it is easier.  I think it is easier.    Same start as HPD but go straight up.  Long lock-off to good crimp, followed by pinches and a blind push to a decent sloper."
High Plains Drifter,7,overhanging,steep,"Start with sharp patina crimps and make some long pulls slightly up and right to gain a couple of slopers. Make a dynamic move off the slopes to gain better holds and an easy, but airy summit.This problem is a North American classic and a must do for the visiting boulderer.As a note of trivia, John Sherman referred to this problem as a benchmark standard for V6 in the first edition of his Hueco guide when he initially introduced the V-scale. However, Sherman was actually referring to Change of Heart, the direct line from the same start as High Plains Drifter. The guidebook at the time mixed up the two names, so most people thought HPD was actually CoH, until Dale Bard (the first ascentionist of both routes) cleared up the confusion."
Pope's Prow,6,slab,technical,"This blunt arête has shattered the egos of many suitors.  Eek your way up the polished prow by hugging the arête and using some small side pulls for the left hand.  Top it off with a adrenaline infused mantle.  A sit down start has been done (F.A. Randy Puro) and checks in at V8.      Originally named for local hardman Mike Pope, although he claims he never climbed it.  This problem is a real Bishop gem and should be attempted by any visiting climber; it is considered a proud send despite its rather meager grade.  Consider that it was given 5.10+ in the old guide."
Butterfinger,11,overhanging,steep,Start a few feet to the left of the start for Mandala. Head straight up.
The Mandala,12,overhanging,steep,"This world renown problem was first climbed by Chris Sharma in the Spring of 2000, and fittingly, it represents the litmus test for the boulderer of the new millennium.  The problem was originally a project tried by many strong climbers of the last decade or so, and it now stands as rite of passage for the new generation of boulderers.      As a few holds have broken since Sharmas ascent, the climb has become a tad harder and a new sequence has been developed.  In the fall of 2002, during the Petzl Roc Trip, Tony Lamiche grabbed the coveted first ascent of the sit down start (dubbed The Mandalion,) that checks in at V13/14, making it one of the harder testpieces in Bishop."
Pain Grain (Stand),5,overhanging,steep,The original Pain Grain. Pull from an excellent jug rail and undercling to a high crimp and work your way over the bulge to a hidden crimp and an easy top out.     Sit start from low hueco dish is a V7 (full value).
Lactose Intolerant,5,vertical,face,"Destined to become classic, this is possibly the best moderate on the 'Cave Boulder'.  Start standing at a flake to the left of 'The Buttermilker' and follow the seam up to join the top-out of 'The Buttermilker'.      Power yields to a slotting adventure.  Don't gum up the holds of 'The Buttermilker' with your shoe rubber..."
Cave Route,6,overhanging,steep,Takes the obvious line on the north side of the Cave Boulder.    Start low and make easy moves to a good hold.   Either make a long reach or make a difficult sequence up to a large sidepull/pocket.   Pull over onto the slab and finish easily.
Pain Grain SDS,7,overhanging,steep,"Sit-start on holds atop the large scoop feature.  Work up and left on small holds and toe/heel hooks to the massive, sharp jug start hold of Pain Grain stand-start.  Continue up on sharp holds to the cruxy topout.  The sit is so much better than the stand, if you can do the moves just go for the sit.    Stand-start is v5"
Little Forgotten,10,overhanging,steep,"Stand start matched underclinging a large hueco feature as for ""Moonraker"". Pull on to the wall and move up to some slopey holds on smooth quartz monzonite and utilize a variety of heelhooks, body tension, and a kneebar or two. Trend leftwards with a hard foot stab and a hard match on a hueco's rib before climbing up and topping out as for ""The Buttermilker"".     This problem offers some relief from the classic Buttermilk death-grip crimps and revolves around compression moves on bigger holds."
Buttermilker,13,overhanging,technical,Utter perfection. This problem is a thing of pure beauty. Super hard! Start seated matched on a good sidepull and trend right through amazing slopey compression moves requiring sustained strong body tension and cool careful footwork. There are crystals available for those who prefer microcrimps to slopers.    Featured in Dosage Vol. 1 and there are now numerous ascent videos on the web.
Robinson's Rubber Tester,0,slab,technical,"Delicate slab moves up exquisite rock make this a must for the grade.    The climbing isn't hard, but the moves keep you honest all the way up the easy angled slab."
Soul Slinger Right,8,vertical,technical,"Start as for Soul Slinger, but move up and right, eventually gaining the large hueco.  The use of a left hand sloper and some small feet should help.  Pretty cool."
Soul Slinger,9,overhanging,dyno,"Tommy Klinefelter is responsible for establishing this perfect arête problem.  Start on innocuous incut flakes and make a long pull up to the insecure holds above.  Continue clinging for dear life, and finish by lunging out left to an obvious teacup pocket at the lip.      This often photographed line is one of the most aesthetic problems at the milks."
Good Morning Sunshine,1,slab,technical,"The perfect morning warmup.    Climb up the steep slab using crimps, side-pulls and high-steps to an exciting crux up high."
Green Wall Essential,2,slab,technical,"Technical crimps and polished foot holds are the name of the game for the start.   After a couple of great moves, larger holds are reached, from which the top is easily gained."
East Rib,3,slab,technical,"Start with angling crimpers on the east side.     The crux comes in the first couple moves, but hold onto your hat, the mental crux is just below the top out."
Green Wall Center,6,vertical,technical,Start low with two opposing sidepulls. Good footwork on slippery feet will lead you to a right high step and a long reach to a vertical slot. Continue straight up and finish in a jug.
Roadside Highball,3,vertical,face,Climb the center of the tall face that faces the road. Getting off the ground and gaining the top may be tricky.
Marsha's Scoop (AKA Marsha's Nipple),5,vertical,technical,Originally called V7 it was downgraded after several ascents but feels way stout till you find the right sequence. Still probably V7 on a hot day....   Climb the small scoop up the center to a slopey topout. Start standing with a terrible nipple/crimp for the left hand and the right hand on one of several options. Getting off the ground is tough. The topout is not as easy as you might hope. Great little climb that deserves to see more action.
Bowling Pin,4,overhanging,steep,This brilliant problem starts up the steep north face using side pulls and underclings.   The crux is reached when a couple small crimps allow access to a good sloping sidepull out left.    Pull around this onto the slab and up to the top.
Bowling Pin Sit,6,overhanging,steep,No text - use the 'Improve This Page' link to add something useful!
Iron Man Traverse,4,overhanging,traverse,"Climb the obvious rail from left to right.  Easy moves provide encouragement, until the rail gets smaller near the end.  Good incuts and determination help gain the sloper out on the right lip.  Match on this and swing your right foot high and complete a classic."
Iron Man Sit,4,overhanging,crack,"Start with hands matched on the rail, then bust out right through the crack. Rest up in the chimney, then finish up on Ironman."
Hero Roof,0,overhanging,steep,"One of the best warm-ups in the 'Milks.  A couple laps on this will get the blood flowing on those crisp mornings.    Sit-start low on big patina edges on the right side of the overhanging face, then work your way up and left along the lip of the roof on good jugs.  Pull over to a jug on the top."
Problem C,2,slab,technical,Make some tricky moves up the slab.   After a couple of high steps good holds are reached and the problem is done.
Monkey Dihedral,2,slab,technical,"Stem your way up the shallow scoop into the ""dihedral"" using good sidepulls, gastons and other edges.  Exit right at the top of the dihedral or continue straight up for full value."
Saigon,6,overhanging,technical,"This awesome singular prow problem on perfect rock is a 3 move wonder in between easier sections, but man, those are 3 killer moves.    Teasingly easy entry moves lead to two height-dependent crux sequences. For most taller people like myself, its a wild lean out right with the right hand to a sloper-type thingy utilizing a left heel hook. A left hand power up to a bulbous crimp sets you up for the big, flying move to a killer jug! Match and crank off a few knobs and small but positive plates up off the deck, to the blunt top out.     Other people may have to match hands on the bulbous crimp (YIKES!!) and continue.    IMO this is a height-dependent rating...    This boulder problem is sooo good, it got me psyched to get my pads out of storage!!"
Saigon Direct,8,overhanging,steep,"Though not quite as classic as Saigon, this worthy line avoids the punchy Saigon crux via a direct line of holds to the left that lead to a traverse back right into the Saigon finish. In some way it seems easier than Saigon but maybe it's because I'm short. In any case, start as for Saigon. Instead of getting the left hand pinch/sidepull and heading right, move straight up from here via a couple of possible sequences to a high pinch/edge. This is where you start to feel the air beneath you a bit. Move right from this hold with difficulty and rejoin Saigon for the finish."
Sheepherder,2,vertical,face,"Really fun climb (kind of a highball). Climb up on some good knobs and crimps into a tall, shallow groove.    Focus on footwork and make some balancey moves to top out."
Yeast,3,vertical,technical,"Climb the wall just left of a prominent black-streaked groove, beginning with nice bulbous holds, but ending with small crimps that lead extremely tenuously around a slight bulge on poor footholds.  Frightening"
The Rising,4,overhanging,face,Two different starts both go to a crimp above head-height.  Move up and left to finishing jug above bush.
Nan Bread,4,slab,technical,"Some thin crimps, balancey sidepulls and precise edging lead to better holds up high and a much more secure finish than the lines to the right."
East Side Story,3,vertical,face,"Start by leaning off an adjacent boulder, then follow a line of mostly pretty good holds up and right to a long reach way off the deck.  Technically it's a notch easier than Jedi Mind Tricks but instead of the crux being the first move, it's the last.    Great rock, cool moves and a distinct line: total classic."
Flyboy Arete,5,overhanging,technical,Start as for the Flyboy sit start and move left to the arete and up.  Crimpy and good.
Flyboy,6,overhanging,steep,"Start on the high jug and sidepull, move up on steep sidepulls and a crimp to a big move for the lip.     Try the sit-start to the left to add some spice..."
Flyboy SDS,8,overhanging,dyno,Start down and left of the stand to 'Flyboy' and head up and right on crimps to join the crux dyno of 'Flyboy'.
The Fall Guy,9,overhanging,technical,"A tall and proud new skool classic.  Stand start using small crimps.  Make a hard move up and left, then continue crimping up a steep patina headwall over a scary landing.      The landing zone has evolved from a wooden pallet to a terrace of rocks.  One of the best of its grade in Bishop."
Stained Glass,10,vertical,technical,Small polished patina crimps and slick feet lead to a big toss for the lip off a tiny left-hand crimp.      Warm your fingers up before attempting...
Haroun & the Sea of Stories,11,overhanging,technical,A low start to The Fall Guy.  Do some crazy over-the-head heel hooking to solve the linkage into the start of The Fall Guy.  Classic!    Named after a book by Salman Rushdie.
Funky Tut,3,slab,face,"Start as 'King Tut', but trend to the right after the first moves, then up via some funky, insecure moves.  A funk classic."
King Tut,3,slab,technical,This is a slightly technical and balancy problem with a commiting topout.    Start with a right-hand pinch and left hand on top of a low bulb. Move directly up through the knobs and shallow scoops to the crux lip.
Milk the Milks,6,slab,face,"Sit start down right, with hands on the two lower crimps.   Pull up and make a hard reach up and left to a good crimp on the rail / lip.   Move left along the rail and when possible move straight up pulling past a couple of small slopers."
Yayoi Right,7,slab,technical,Technical and insecure climbing with bad feet on a vertical face.    Stand-start on a left-hand incut and a tiny right-hand sidepull.  Work up and right on a series of right-facing sidepulls/gastons and terrible footholds to a short horizontal rail just below the top.  A stout mantle will finish you off.      There's also a direct start to the right (same difficulty).
Buttermilk Stem,1,slab,technical,A must-do for the Buttermilks visitor.    Stand-start with wide palms and make a tricky first move to get your right foot on (crux).  Stem your way up to the good fin and jugs to the easy but great top-out.    Sit-start is considered v4 and requires some creativity/funk.
Buttermilk Stem SDS,4,vertical,steep,A cool sit start to the already classic Buttermilks Stem problem. Starts matched on the juggy undercling and just pull up and press into the V1. Super fun extra couple moves
Black Dot,5,slab,face,"An excellent route with fun movement and good holds. Start by getting your hand in the big hole by doing a little jump then matching hands, get your feet high and reach left to the little black dot hold, then bump a bit higher, get your foot in the hole, and simply climb to the top."
Cheezy Brit Sit Start,7,slab,technical,"Sit start as for ""Buttermilk Stem Sit Start""  matched on an undercling jug. Pull on and move up the grainy arete using some foot trickery and some high steps and smears. Continue up the arete on vanishing sidepull slopers until you can reach high to a better sloper before finishing up a slab on buckets."
Brian's Project,8,overhanging,technical,Sit/squat start far right on an ok left hand crimp and a miserable right hand incut.  Paste your left foot on a good hold and work up the hanging arete via slopers and heel hooks.  Once you get the good left hand pinch reset your feet and make a big move to the good sloper directly above your head.  Top out from here on slopers to easy slab.  Doing just the finishing moves of this problem deserves a V4 I think.
Matt's Project Sit,9,vertical,face,Sit start as for Buttermilk Stem matched on the undercling. Move up the arete and then join Matt's Project going out right.
Buttermilk Gem,1,slab,face,"An underrated tall slab.    Make a tricky first move to get off the ground onto the slab (crux), then climb straight up just left of the arete."
Junior's Achievement,7,slab,technical,Thin face climbing on barely-there crimps leads to an awkward crux near the top. Taller folks sometimes start from the left. One of my favorite lines in Buttermilk Country!
Hobbs' Problem,2,vertical,technical,"Most will find the crux is getting off the ground on this one.    Stand-start on the sloping dishes.  Make a couple tricky moves up to the left-hand sloper, then break right to the black knob and finish in the water pocket jug."
Leary-Bard Left,5,vertical,technical,Climb the left side of the Leary Bard arete with some tricky footwork and big balls.
Leary/Bard Arete,5,vertical,technical,Work your way up the right side of the arete using thin sharp crimps and keen footwork.  Finish with a tricky and insecure slab top-out.
The Hunk,2,slab,technical,"A super classic high slab, satisfying and exciting. Tricky and technical climbing down low on small edges leads to easier, but committing moves on good holds to the top. Superb!"
Early Exit,5,slab,face,"Start sitting in the small alcove in the middle of the West face with a nice horizontal pinch for both hands. Climb up and right past underclings, then up the face using small crimps and maybe a sidepull. Top out (crux) with a long move to a couple of bulges. Awesome!!!!   This only got 2 stars in the guidebook...sad."
Upside,8,vertical,technical,Sit start at the base with a large flat edge / pinch. Make a few really fun and unique moves that takes you to a couple small sharp crimps. Now stare at the blank face and wonder what you do next? The entry moves on this problem are really good and you climb into a very powerful or technical crux section. There are a couple invisible micro crimps that can be used. There is also a 1 finger pad spike. Going out right to a gaston is probably the way for shorter folks. Taller folks can lock off hard and go straight up.
Bachar Problem Left,5,vertical,technical,Go up the left side of the south face using slick feet and holds all facing weird angles.
Pope's Problem,3,slab,face,One of the best lines anywhere.  A punchy crux right off the bat and then it backs way off (5.8-9ish).  The position and the height make for an exciting finish.  Enjoy.
Southwest Face,4,slab,face,"Stand start at the left side of the roof (Where ""Pope's Roof"" Joins). Pull up and go straight to the top."
Popes Roof,6,overhanging,steep,"This pulls the obvious roof on the SW Face, then follows the Southwest Face route to the top."
Smooth Shrimp,6,overhanging,traverse,Start on Perfectly Chicken. Traverse low left all the way to top out at the top of the Flakes.
Bubba Gump,10,overhanging,steep,"Sit-start low right on a sidepull flake.  Make a couple of moves to gain the slopey crimps, move to an ok incut left hand, top out on nice holds."
The Womb (Birthing Experience),1,overhanging,technical,"A fun and silly little party trick; lowball for the 'Milks.    Start lying down (fetal position preferred) in the womb alcove/scoop.  Without dabbing or pulling a back muscle, contort your body in such a way that allows you to reach the big incut way up and out to the left, then finish on good holds.    Can be a good time after a few beers, blind-folded and/or barefoot."
Tubular,1,vertical,face,Start on the flake and throw a hand to the square pinch. Get some solid feet and work through the slab. Finish on the bomber side pull on the arête to the right.
Sharma Traverse,10,overhanging,traverse,"Traverse the lip right to left on slopers and a big move between two edges(crux), and then top out. Super fun!"
Pinch Arete,7,vertical,mantle,Pull of the ground with difficulty using a right hand pinch and a left heel hook. Slap the lip and do a hard mantle. Surprisingly good rock!
Dale's Right,2,overhanging,face,"Nice edging with fun moves.    Start right-hand on the sloping crimp in the small, shallow, and orange hueco, and left-hand on a small but good incut.  Work up and right to the patina following the edges to a large move to another good edge.  Nice little lunge to the top."
Dale's Left,3,vertical,face,"Move up on small crimps to a seam, then over the bulge with inobvious edges to the top."
Cuban Roll,3,overhanging,steep,"A Dale's classic.    Start high with crimps on the steep wall.  Make a couple powerful moves to the jug around the lip, pull over and around the lip using slopers and transition to the slab finish."
Green Hornet,4,slab,technical,Excellent technical face climbing on bullet patina.  One of the best moderates at Dale's.    Climb small but good edges straight up the black streak to a committing crux near the top.
Zen Flute,10,vertical,dyno,A difficult line with an inviting opening sequence and a sizable dyno finish.      Start on the obvious shallow right-facing flake.  Work up to small crimps in the horizontal seam and make an all-out leap of faith to a jug on the lip (crux).
Swiss Legends,6,overhanging,steep,"An awesome overhanging power problem finishing on slopers!    Start low on two smooth incut crimps. Pull on to the wall and make a big move with the left hand to hidden sidepull jugs on the left lip.    From here bring your right hand to more hidden holds, or bump the left hand. Then grab the lip overhead and finish up on glassy slopers.    Temperature dependent but an awesome climb!"
Xavier's Roof,8,overhanging,mantle,"Definitely one of the best problems in Bishop if not anywhere.Sit start on small crimps and climb up into the good flake undercling. Continue onto the lip, make a couple of moves left and right, figure out how to get your foot to face level, and then mantel (or throw) to the big smiley jug. Careful on the top-out.  This problem can be more difficult for those who are either really tall or really short. It's probably helpful to be average-height and flexible. There's also a variety of ways to do this problem."
Gastonia,8,vertical,face,Stand start with a good left hand sidepull. Climb up using a series of sharp gastons.
Hueco Wall,9,vertical,dyno,"Stand start at sidepull crimps down and right of the prominent hueco. Get your feet up high and make an awkward lunge or dyno for the smooth hueco in the middle of the wall. Looks easier than it is! From the smooth hueco, grab the top of it as an undercling and make a few hard pulls to gain the lip. The holds aren't that great for the top out, but there is a bomber spot to put your heel hook in for the mantel."
Small Fruit,3,vertical,face,"Climb the arete, using the good clean holds to gain a patina crack."
Pity the Fool,2,vertical,crack,"Start sitting with your hands in the largest, obvious crack on the west face of the boulder. Follow the crack up and left, but top out right of the bulging nose for full value."
Soldier of Fortune,5,vertical,face,"This climb is on the tall boulder to the south of the A-Team Boulder. Start standing on the southwestern side of the boulder, between the boulder and the tree. Match your hands, side-pulling on the obvious crack. Climb up with difficulty to an easier top out. The lower holds feel a bit hollow, so take care. The holds at the top are bullet hard."
Mr. T's Wild Ride,6,vertical,dyno,"Start sitting on the fallen boulder section, with your hands in the lower of the parallel cracks. Move up into the higher crack, and set your hands in an undercling for a dyno to the lip! Fantastic!"
Secrets of the Beehive,6,vertical,technical,Either sit down for full value or begin at the obvious flake. The opening moves are the most physically demanding while the last the most technical and committing.
Flight of the Bumblebee,8,overhanging,steep,"A crazy looking line on beautiful rock!   Start with a jump to a huge jug. From here climb up and right following a crack system. When the crack ends, pull it together and climb on to some good incut edges and then the crux sequence! Climb up and over the bulge with some balance and holds that aren't as good as you'd like. From here climb up to the lip on improving holds and top out with care!    Biffing the top out isn't an option!   The line is at least thirty-five feet tall over a slightly blocky landing."
The Swarm Direct,13,overhanging,steep,"Surprisingly this little guy wasn't done until recently. Start as for the Swarm but instead of going out right, climb up via hard pulls on small crimpers."
The Sloth,9,overhanging,steep,Sit start down under the overhang on a rail. Start with hands matched where the crack opens up. Move right along crimps before busting some long powerful moves out into the daylight. Snag the large patina jug and shake out for the crux top out. Great movement and a good power endurance problem.
Body and Soul,5,overhanging,face,Go straight up the prominent arete to a somewhat highball topout.
The Swarm,14,overhanging,steep,One of America's finest crimp testpieces! Beautiful bulletproof quartz monzonite with small smooth holds in a majestic location!    Stand Start matched on a small right facing side pull and make a big move up left hand to a small crimp. From here make another long reach up with your other hand to a decent crimp rail. Position your feet and come in for the match! Then bust another move out right to another small crimp. Get a high left foot and do a big cross to a small flake.    Reach over with the right hand to a decent hold at the arete. Swap the left hand from a crimp to a side pull and gather all you have left in the gas tank. Make a big dynamic move up to the last hold. Crimp down hard on the left hand side pull in order to hold the swing! Match the diagnol lip and get up there! Finish up the slab(money) or walk righwards and drop down.    The Swarm Direct(v13) has also been done by Nalle in 2011. Instead of going right on the small seams and rails climb direct using whatever looks somewhat holdable!
Northwest Arete,8,overhanging,technical,"A proud arete with powerful pulls in between crimps and small mini-pinches. Apparently, this was the first line to be climbed on the boulder, and it rarely sees repeats. Squat start low and follow the arete and a few holds just above the arete over an increasingly bad landing with the last few moves being the crux."
Rise,9,overhanging,steep,An inspiring super-highball with a powerful overhanging intro leading to a tall slab that is most likely harder than it looks. Stand start above the slightly chossy rock on large pinch-like features and make a few hard moves up before eventually rocking out onto the slab. Continue up and then slightly left keeping a cool head. It might help not to look down while on the slab...
Luminance,9,overhanging,dyno,"Said by some to be the best climb in Bishop, this one will definitely make your heart race and your legs wobble.    Stand Start at a good jug rail and busy a huge move up to a small crimp. Match then head out right to improving holds and an increasingly scary landing. Match the rail with left foot on the start hold and cut feet. Hold on and then get your right foot on and make another big move up. From here you can drop down and match the previous rail and bail or go for the send and make another huge move to a good hold below the lip above a no-fall zone.    From here take some deep breaths and climb on to the lip via a mantle or some beached whale action.    A beautifully clean line with big power moves on good crimps. Bring your friends and possibly some crutches."
Too Big To Flail,10,vertical,technical,"A beautiful looking line. More popular on top rope, and one of the most committing highballs in the Bishop area.    Stand Start on top of some rocks to the right of a small pit. Right hand on a glassy two finger crimp-jug and left hand on a small crimp. Pull on or reach up from the rocks to a good jug. From here take a deep breath and take your time placing your feet. Make a long journey up via small crimps and high steps until you can finally reach better holds at the lip and eventually a bucket on top.   From here crawl up and kiss the rock and thank yourself and everyone else for the support and strength for the send.    Then, take out your notebook and check off the high ball climb of a lifetime.    Do this on top rope till you are comfortable with the Holds and with yourself, physically and mentally."
Form Destroyer,12,overhanging,steep,A short crimp test-piece on an awesome roof. Start at a smooth hueco and make a big move to a tiny crimp. From here bump up to the lip and take the foot cut without dabbing! Match and obtain better holds and top out on good flakes and finish up a slab.     Enjoy the fine view of the secluded area and Buttermilk country once on top of the boulder.   A scrunchy heel hook could prove crucial at the beginning.
Sketchpad,0,vertical,technical,"An amazing line that requires careful technique from start to finish. Climb up the ~30' tall slab on small edges. The beginning is cruxy, then you get a reprieve on some bigger edges before committing to the topout."
Approaching Silence,6,vertical,face,This is the first obvious boulder you come to hiking into the Hall of Mirrors. It ascends ever thinning holds up the middle of a steepening face to a crux move to an incut black inclusion high on the face.
Sylvia Plath,6,vertical,face,"Up the hill from Approaching Silence are a handful more problems, the most striking of which is Silvia Plath. This line ascends a right facing flake on a flawless porcelain wall. Cruxy to get started, and puzzling up high as the flake peters out into blank porcelain slab. The height and proximity of a large rock behind you make the top moves very committing."
Evil Empire,6,overhanging,dyno,An interesting line with unique movement. Start at a glassy slopey rail which has a few good spots on it. Make two hard pull to small edges and then make a dyno up to a big flat protrusion. Not as good as you want it to be and slightly chossy. Might be worth climbing up and brushing.     A static approach is possible by doing an awkward press/ mantel and going left hand to a sloper then bumping up.    Once established on the sloper jug climb up via some more slopers and make a high step finishing maneuver to get on top.    From the start it seems you could go up to the edges at right and make a few hard pulls to gain a good crimp edge. Looks like a fun project.
Solitaire,8,overhanging,dyno,"Solitaire is a must do if you like big moves to decent holds. More than worth the hike on it's own, it's also a good stop on the way to or from Dale's Camp.    Start matched on the lower rail, and toss a big move to the next rail.  Match again, and toss an even bigger move to a hold on the lip."
Judge Not,9,overhanging,dyno,"A dyno and dead-point test-piece. If you like dyno's and steep overhanging faces along with a bit of choss, you'll love this.     Start low at two crimps, the left has recently broken, but the first move is a big move left hand to a side pull. From here gather up your strength and find your feet and launch up right hand to a good side pull flake.    Let out a Sharma scream and take the swing! Make a few more big moves up and right to top out carefully on hollow holds. A little brittle, and slightly sharp.    Bring skin, superglue, tape, and crutches.   This line obtains classic in the Bishop Select guidebook.   youtube.com/watch?v=s56pGCr…"
Blood Kin,1,overhanging,steep,"On the south face, start with good patina holds above a small cave. Make a few tricky moves, then a big move to the top of the patina. Mantel to the top of the patina then use a cool patina-lined hueco to gain the top of the boulder."
Nicole Face,3,overhanging,traverse,"Start at the bottom, go up and traverse right along cool patina to the top."
Painted Cave,6,overhanging,steep,"One of the most unique climbs in the area, this climb utilizes a variety of different sized huecos on the outside of a large cave-like roof found on the south western side of the boulder. This is a powerful sloper testpiece, so bring some skin and some psych for this burly classic!    Sit start at the rightside of The large cave on a flat shelf in a hueco. Make a few hard moves left to the edge of the roof and set up for a reach to a hueco outside the cave. From here swing over and match the slopey hueco. Once matched, figure out how to reach up the the sun-baked slopers before a committing last move to a good hold!"
"Slashface of the Buttermilks, Sit",8,overhanging,face,"Start sitting, matched on the sloper in the center of the face, and make a crux move up into the seam as for Slashface of the Buttermilks. Follow the seam to top out."
Trigger Hippy,3,vertical,face,"Located on the North-east arete of the  summit block.  Climb edges up the east face and arete to your right over a bad landing.  A classic, airy outing that deserves more traffic.  There is a bolt on top.    This block may offer other committing lines for highball aficionados."
Xen,2,vertical,technical,"An area classic and balance/ footwork test piece!   On the downhill side of the boulder, stand start and climb up the scoop using slopers and small xenolith features until you can reach the large hueco up and right near the summit to top out."
Rex Kwon Do stand,7,overhanging,technical,"A beautiful arete on smooth porcelain rock. Powerful and technical but friendly on the skin, IMO one of the best V7 in Bishop."
Rex Kwon Do,10,overhanging,technical,Sit down start on the perfectly smooth arete. Pull on and follow the arete up and left using mini pinches and lots of tension. A bad sloper for the left and a blind move to a small right hand sidepull may be useful for the hard topout.
Psyche Transfer sent,6,overhanging,dyno,"Sit start on left side face with a right hand on a small gaston patina crimp and left on a flat lip, put left foot on same rail as left hand. At or after the undercling bust right and either dyno or static with higher tenuous feet to a good jug and roll around onto the slab to top! This may have been climbed before, please comment as applicable."
Psyche Transfer Recieved,6,overhanging,face,"Sit start on left side face with a right hand on a small gaston patina crimp and left on a flat lip, put left foot on same rail as left hand. Then climbs a move or two tight before heading straight up with unique movement and cool stepthroughs, the top is thin and would recommend sussing before committing. This may have been climbed before, please comment as applicable."
A Maze of Death,12,overhanging,dyno,Sit start at a large smooth and glassy undercling. Pull on to the wall and move up and slightly right making very precise hard moves up the slightly overhanging wall.The last move is a small jump to a sinker bucket at the lip. Top out on jugs.
This Side of Paradise,9,overhanging,face,"Stand start off of the pile of rocks and reach up to the jug. Pull onto the wall and climb up the huge prow using a series of crimps, sidepulls, and lots of power endurance. Top out high off the deck."
The Beautiful and Damned,13,overhanging,steep,Hard moves up a tall clean face. Overhanging powerful moves on small crimps lead to a thin and airy slab which leads to the top of the boulder.
The Glass Face,5,vertical,technical,Straight up the middle of the striking vertical face on glassy little crimps.
Unknown,3,overhanging,mantle,One of the best lines here. Start under the steep east face of the massive boulder at a big round undercling. Climb up and left out the steep flakes until it is possible to mantel up into the little alcove. Either downclimb from here and drop or continue around the arete to the right and up the slab with blatant disregard for your safety. High but with a pretty good landing. A wicked hard sit start looks possible.
Cracked,3,vertical,crack,The obvious diagonal crack is climbed from a sit.
Cracked Arete,4,overhanging,technical,The overhanging arete left of the crack. Start low and make technical moves up and left.
Tang,5,vertical,face,"Sit start at the north arete. Follow the line of flake crimps up and left to a match at the big breadloaf shaped boss, then straight up to the lip and over."
Lubricated Baby Boomers,5,overhanging,mantle,"Start on good jugs and work up through obvious sharp crimps to a slopey and technical topout. The crux is topping out and mantling with blind feet. It looks and feels super easy at first glance, but then you try topping it and realize why the grade is what it is. Technical climbing to finish this one. Press hard and pray!"
Baby Steps to Greatness,8,overhanging,traverse,"A short but difficult crux on poor feet and terrible holds, it lends itself to easier but pumpy climbing to finish. The boulder requires some endurance as it traverses left-to-right on the most beautiful low ball line imaginable. Crux is rather difficult to ponder. Extra points for flashing, it's a puzzle worth solving!"
Sex Kitten,11,overhanging,traverse,"A very sustained crux for endurance lovers. This project traverses the same direction as it's counterpart, ""Baby Steps to Greatness,"" but instead traverses the lower seam versus the upper seam on ""Baby Steps."" *See picture  Terrible, shallow, and sharp incuts with scrunchy feet and horizontal body movements, this is sure to be an area classic once it cleans up. May be easier for shorter people at times... Shares the same start as ""Lubricated, & Baby Steps."""
Fear of the Unknown,3,vertical,face,"This is a stand start up the center of the Sacrificial Boulder's south face. Make big lock-offs between patina jugs. Near the lip the patina runs out and you face the ""Fear of the Unknown."""
Fear of the Unknown (Sit),5,vertical,face,"Sit start on the obvious sidepull. Move through crimps to the positive patina pulling. Big moves flow to the jug rail at the lip. The crux is facing ""The Fear of the Unknown."""
Dark Matter,10,overhanging,steep,"Start in the cave, to the undercling, to the lip, bust up right."
Blood Kin Sit,4,overhanging,steep,"Sit start in the cave below Blood Kin with both hands in obvious flat holds in the back of a hueco. Pull up into underclings at the lip of the cave, then continue up to join Blood Kin. A knee bar or two may be useful."
Golden Child,9,overhanging,face,Sit-start matched on the undercling and make a hard move out and left to a sloper.  Use edges to gain the lip and finish on the slab.
Head Butt,1,slab,technical,"On the Hall of the Mountain Queen slab boulder, this committing V1 requires precise footwork to gain the security of the seamy jugs halfway up. A must do problem!"
There Is No Party (Right),1,slab,technical,Start on very thin crimps and climb up and slightly right past better crimps and a good horizontal crack to the juggy lip.
Problem A,1,slab,technical,Located between Head Butt and There is no Party Left (variation) this problem takes a direct line up the slab.    Start with a high step up the make a couple of committing moves on poor feed to reach better holds below the lip.    Finish direct.
There Is No Party (Left Variation),2,slab,technical,"Start on the two conspicuous large crimps. Make a tricky move up using a tiny crimp to stand on the starting holds. Then move right slightly, using a better diagonal hold to walk the feet up and grab the top. Harder variation (v3/4?) heads up and slightly left from the two big crimps using horrendous tiny feet and NOT the crack of head butt. Easier variation continues further right from the diagonal crimp to the horizontal crack of There Is No Party (Right)"
Pretty In Pink,2,slab,technical,"Using small feet and all sorts of awkward motion, climb up to and up the ramp. Could be done either using the ramp for hands with feet below, or ramp for feet with hands above, or both. A bit contrived as it comes very close to Head Butt at the top and it is hard to avoid bailing out right to the better holds of that problem."
Morning Glory,4,overhanging,face,Sit start and climb wonderous angled crimps to an easier but tallish top out
Izzy Lizzy,4,vertical,face,Sit start with hands on the large flake.    Make engaging moves before a large move of an undercut gains entry to the upper section of the problem.    Finish direct.
The Eyes,0,vertical,face,Climb directly up the face passing through the eyes.
Guilty Conscience,6,overhanging,steep,"Sit start at good huecos and climb up to some good underclings via hard moves. Once you get to the lip of the roof, make a move out left to another undercling and then up with a huge span to a good crimp rail. Maybe for those who can't pull of ""Skye Dance"" or those who have already done it."
Skye Dance,6,overhanging,steep,A unique and very worthy line.  Can't be missed.    Start on the two lowest slopers down in the cave and move up to the triangular undercling near the lip of the roof.  Work your way around the bulge with widely spaced crimps to the top-out.
McCallum,6,overhanging,traverse,"A fun traverse with excellent movement. Sit start on the flat hueco as for ""Soul Window"" and traverse right into the giant underclings of ""Skye Dance"". Top out as for the previously mentioned line on decent crimps kind of high off the deck."
Cayla,7,overhanging,steep,Sit start low in the cave and make fun steep moves to a crimpy lip encounter.      Tiff named this one after her doggy.
Through the Window,8,overhanging,face,"Sit start on the flat hueco as for ""Soul Window"", but break away after climbing out from the bulge with a long hard move out left to some good crimps. Continue climbing up and left and finish with a classic topout through the hole in the boulder! Incredible!"
Gasperini,11,overhanging,face,"For the monsters looking for something slightly more challenging than ""The Sloth"" or ""Golden Child"". Bring lots of skin and tons of psyche for this aesthetic line.    Sit start with a small sharp left hand crimp and a slopey right hand undercling. Pull on to the wall and execute hard moves up and slightly left utilizing sharp crimps and the hueco. A big move gains jugs at the lip."
All Fired Up,7,overhanging,technical,"A beautiful sweeping overhanging arete on good patina.    Climb the striking, near-perfect arete!"
Thunder,3,overhanging,face,"The line just to the right of 'Kredulf'.  Start low on crimps, make a move or two up to a small jug and one more move will get you to the sloper on the lip.  Top-out."
Kredulf,4,overhanging,face,"Sit-start on edges and work straight up on crimps and edges to the jug up high, then top-out on the rounded lip."
Denton's Diversion,7,overhanging,face,Sit start on a large horizontal slot to the right of Kredulf.  Climb diagonally left via hard moves to jugs then traverse right to same top out as Kredulf.
Old Ei,8,overhanging,mantle,"Sit start with a decent left hand crimp and a large hueco for the right hand. Make a few hard moves on sloper crimps and utilize the hueco as a foothold. From here make a few more moves to a jug on the lip, and then execute a hard mantel."
Denton's Remorse,10,overhanging,technical,"Sit start on friendly underclings down and left. Slide on in there and pull off the ground with difficulty. Get a tricky kneebar and make a move out right to a decent hold. From here make a hard move left hand to a grainy undercling. Pull hard and make a hard low percent move to the good slot. From here make a few more hard moves in between decent holds and then start moving right. Once to the lip of the boulder, go all in and pull off a topout which is slightly harder than you may want it to be."
Denton Calhoun,11,overhanging,traverse,"Left to right traverse:  Start on the left side of the 'Thunder Wall' down low, on a crimp and a gaston.  Traverse right, staying low and top out on the right side as 'Natural Philosophy'."
Acid Wash Right,9,overhanging,steep,"Sit start as for Acid Wash, but upon hitting the incut, break right with the use of a high edge and funky undercling. The move to the lip is tough to stick.   The stand from the incut goes at V7."
Spoiled Blond,4,overhanging,technical,"A powerful compression boulder problem sit starting on a sloper hueco and a few options for the right hand. Pull on and make a few hard moves up and right utilizing the huecos. Make a committing move to a grainy sloper with some trickery, and commit to a good sloper out left. From here top out in easier terrain."
Arch Drude,5,overhanging,steep,"An area classic.  If you make the hike up to the Druids and don't get on this, you've missed out.      Sit-start on big holds under the round hueco.  Make a couple easy moves up to the sloping hueco (crux) then up and left on big underclings and sidepulls to an exciting and reachy but juggy top-out."
Arch Drude (Left Start),5,overhanging,steep,Sit start left of the line on the right facing sidepull. Climb up and right to join the top of Arch Drude.
Scoop,0,slab,technical,"Climb the scooped face direct, first by nice technical moves and finish with a classic slabby grovel.   Fun!!"
Hook Line and Sinker,5,overhanging,face,Sit starting from good hold down low. Gain a right hand sidepull (opposition on this one is the crux) and make a long reach to a sharp flake.
Suspenders,5,overhanging,face,"Sit start on flake, move up and right with long moves to small holds."
Kojakian Wisdom Reworked,4,overhanging,traverse,"Sit start as for Who Love's Ya Baby?, but instead of moving straight up traverse rightwards to a crux sequence at the end to gain the large lipped hueco.    Good moves and long, despite the low height of the wall."
One Second,8,overhanging,technical,"Crimpy, slopey, friction and micro-beta dependent with a nails hard topout. Sit-start matched on a low crimp rail. Pull-on a make a hard first move up to a small slopey crimp for the left hand. Execute a hard foot sequence before giving it the mustard and locking-off all the way up to the sloping lip. Match the lip and somehow figure out how not to chuff!"
Lizard Therapy,9,overhanging,technical,"Friction dependent and super skin friendly compared to mostly everything else on the hill top. Stand start with the left hand high on a glassy hueco dish, and right hand undercling down and right. Pull on with a left toe and get a right hand/ heel match on the low hueco. Crank on the heel and release the right hand to another dish up and right. From here set up and go for broke on a desperate move to a jug. So sick."
Lounge Lizards,12,overhanging,dyno,"The crimp testpiece of the area! Huge moves to good crimps followed by a sick dyno to a meathook on the lip. What else could you ask for in a route?    Sit start way underneath the boulder inside a huge hueco. Pull on and crank on a huge drop knee and make a long reach to a good crimper. Match and then make a big move up to a ""Fred-Nicole crimp"". Execute a hard foot swap and get a far left toe before doing another deadpoint, bump to the better hold and set up for the fun finale."
Gleaner Variation,5,overhanging,steep,"Sit start Joseph, work up and left on the fang, follow the angle of the rock up to the ""money pocket"" on the Gleaner. Requires awesome heel hook, pinch, fall in move. Reminded me of the hulk, similar movement."
The Gleaner,6,overhanging,steep,"Start on the undercling at chest-level, make some hard moves up on bad holds to a move out around the lip to a pocket.  Top-out on good edges."
The Gleaner Sit,10,overhanging,steep,"Do you have burly strength, good footwork, and extra skin? Then this is the testpiece for you!    Sit down start matched on a sloper undercling with a good right hand thumb-catch and bad footholds. Pull of the ground with difficulty and make a desperate move to a smooth, glassy, rubber polished gaston. Snag it and hop the right foot up and power into the fang undercling of the stand start. From here move the left hand up to some sharp but good holds and figure out how to get your two fingers into that pocket up high.    Terrible when the foot pops, but extremely satisfying to put down! Classic! Perhaps legendary?"
Weekender,4,overhanging,traverse,"Start in the back of the 'Slowdance Cave', on the left side at good jugs. Traverse right on high jugs to a harder move into good right-slanting flake. Climb up the steep flake using good holds then straight up good jugs into alcove some 18 feet up. From the alcove, either top out straight up on very high jugs, or traverse off left above Rave."
Rave,7,overhanging,technical,"A tuff bouldering classic: powerful, yet technical, and immensely satisfying. Grab the pumice banana and a small right crimp and pull a couple steep moves to the big sloper. Keep it tight for a radical sequence through the large dish to a gaston, and finally, a baseball-sized pocket and the huge shelf. Beautiful.    (Word has it the starting pinch and a crucial foot have been steadily disintegrating over time, so step lightly and/or get this done quick.)"
Standing Kill Order,10,overhanging,steep,Start matched on good left facing finger jug and conjure your way straight up the crimps with some toehook trickery. Super sick!
Kill On Sight,11,overhanging,steep,Sit start to Standing Kill Order. Adds a 2 or 3 burly moves
Corner Route,0,vertical,crack,"A fun and easy crack problem, makes for a good warm-up.    Start on juggy flakes then climb the steep obtuse corner using finger-locks and edges.  Finish in a bucket."
The Tall Wall,1,overhanging,steep,"R/X.  The Tall Wall is tall, slightly overhanging and the landing is potentially terrible if you pitch off to the right.  The climbing is great though - if solid at the grade have a go and enjoy.     Start on the left-facing fin.  Work up on good huecos to the heady crux top-out (it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a buddy on the top pointing out holds on your first go..)"
Browning Variation,4,vertical,face,Begin with both hands in large pocket. Avoid the flakes and good ledge to the right and only use the small pockets up the brown section of the wall!
Jug Start to Acid Wash Right,7,overhanging,steep,"Start one move up from the sit of Acid Wash (V9), avoiding the strenuous first move of the sit"
Snake Charmer,5,vertical,face,"Sit start on the prominent, chalked, vertical rail to the right of the V2 warm up and go using a solid, right crimp and top out direct."
Acid Wash,10,overhanging,steep,"Sit Start at the crimp in the base of the overhanging groove. Make a hard move up to a good incut, then move left through a very hard/reachy section to easier ground."
Big Chicken,4,overhanging,steep,"On the steep South face of the 'Happy Boulder', sit-start on a juggy shelf (same starting holds as 'The Hulk').  Make a tricky sequence up and right onto the arete.  Continue up the steep arete heading left on better holds to a few fun last moves.    Stand-start is v2"
Vulcan Crawl,5,overhanging,traverse,"A left to right traverse on the steep South face of the 'Happy Boulder'.    Start way down and left in the cave below the start of 'Disco Diva'. Make some interesting moves out of the cave and traverse the juggy lip of the cave right with underclings and other good holds, and continue all the way over to finish up the arete of 'Big Chicken'.  Makes those topout moves a little more interesting!"
The Hulk,6,overhanging,steep,"Classic!    On the steep South face of the 'Happy Boulder', sit-start down and right on a juggy shelf. Steep moves lead to a left hand pinch and right hand sidepull/undercling. Make a big move up and left to the big block just below the lip (the ""Boss"" hold). From here, finish either up and left or up and right, same difficulty."
Disco Diva,8,overhanging,steep,"On the left side of the steep south face of the Happy Boulder.     Sit-start under the lip of the small cave, just under the big hueco, with hands using either the left side of the hueco or either of the two thread pockets inside the hueco. Climb straight up using any of a number of tricky sequences to the perfect four finger jug hole just below the lip, top out straight up. Classic!"
Prozac,9,overhanging,dyno,"Start as for the Hulk, but from the pinch and hueco, dyno to the lip directly up and mantle over. Suuuuper sick"
Solarium,4,vertical,dyno,"Just to the right of the arete (Beam Me Up Scottie), crouch-start on some big edges and head up and slightly right.  Climb past a couple sets of thin pockets and make a toss for the lip.  Unlocking the sequence is the crux.      An area classic and a must-do for the grade."
Redrum Sit,10,overhanging,steep,"Sit start with underclings or an undercling plus a low crimp. Make a big move and match hands to join the original start of Redrum. I was told the undercling for the 2nd move broke off in 2012, but there is another (slighly worse) undercling that can be used."
Swing Your Partner Round,2,vertical,traverse,"Start at ""Swing Your Partner"" and then traverse right until you end at the start of ""Grant's Christmas Present""  Its is a super fun hang with great jugs for feet and hands."
Celestial Trail,0,slab,face,"Start at a good sized hueco.    Pull up and onto the slab and follow it, via nice slab moves, to the top.      For the tick don't escape right onto the arete."
Heavenly Path,1,slab,face,Climb jugs to a large hueco/undercling. Pull onto the the slab for an exciting finish on crimps.
Goldfish Trombone,14,overhanging,steep,"Start in the back of the overhang on thin pockets. Move up and left, under the prow and through a horrendous series of pockets, edges, and pinches. Finish by emerging on to the far side of the prow, making long & delicate reaches. Top it out, or walk off after the jug."
Action Figure,6,overhanging,steep,"The original line on the wall.  Used to be harder (or at least more painful) 'till someone filed out the bottom of the mono after it had already been done...    Nonetheless, great pulls on steep pockets.  Can be topped out, but not as fun as stepping off."
Cholos,9,overhanging,steep,"Start on pockets and climb out the black streak.  You can top it out, but I don't recommend it.  One of the original testpieces at the Happies."
Blue Note Special,0,vertical,face,Start up the right side of the short smooth wall.    At the break traverse left on goods holds then up via a cool move off the rail onto a couple of small but positive crimps.    Nice movement.
Sixty Foot Woman Traverse,2,overhanging,traverse,"A left to right traverse of the wall.    The pump is slow to arrive, but as you near the prow on the right the pump will come.      Move past the prow and finish easily."
Althea,0,slab,face,Climb directly up the face with a couple of long moves to get established on the slab.    A great problem in a great position.
Spinal Snap,2,overhanging,steep,Sit start at the large undercling and move up with big moves on great holds.   Move slightly right and then up and right to finish.
Cue Ball,4,overhanging,steep,"Sit start at the good pocket in the middle of the cave.   Pull out right and then up to the arete via a pocket which you think should be much better than it feels.    With right hand on the arete launch up and left to either the top jug or a side pull then the top jug.    A good steep problem on slopers, best left to cool afternoons."
Rio's Secret Arete,3,vertical,technical,"In the chimney to the right of the prominent arete you will find the ""secret arete"". Climb the balancy arete. Optional sit start at the same grade."
Atari,6,vertical,technical,"Dubbed ""The World's Shortest Highball"", Atari Arete is one of the most aesthetic boulder problems on the east side of the Sierras (or anywhere) and offers an exciting finish. What starts off as a wide sloping bear-hug style arete, eventually becomes narrower and less secure. Most beta involves heel-hooking one side of the arete (generally the right side) as you squeeze the arete and pull off the ground. Keep your eye out for marginal foot smears as you pull off the ground and again higher up. There is no real defined crux, however reaching a critical thumb-pocket high and right allows you to adjust your feet and work your left hand up before eventualy throwing for the lip."
Done With The South,5,overhanging,steep,Start at the left facing flake then move quickly up the steeping wall passing pockets to make a huge move up to a great hold over the lip.    Turn the lip and finish easily.    Watch your back on the boulder below.
Water Saps,7,overhanging,steep,"Start on an obvious flake and head left out the pocketed roof to join with Done With the South.  The landing is blocky, but the climbing is extraordinary.  Though obscure, this problem is one of the best at the Happy's."
Black Magic,3,vertical,technical,"Climb directly up the middle of the tall slabby face until the break at 3/4 height.   Take a breath and continue up passing a good pocket to the top.    It's tall, but with good technique not too tricky."
Blood Simple,4,overhanging,steep,Sit start below the blunt arete.   Move up the pocketed wall on the right until a big move up and left allows for a good side-pull to be reached.    From the side pull continue up the prow with one last hard pull up to the flat hand ledge.    Downclimb or drop off.
"A Flake As Marvelous As You, Veruca",0,slab,face,Climb the flake in the middle of the face for great moves and good exposure as you climb up high above the canyon.
Tall Wall Middle,3,vertical,face,"Highball.      Stand-start high with good edges on the vertical wall.  Make a big stretch up and right to a big square-cut sidepull, and head up on edges, OR go straight up from the starting holds on crimps and sidepulls.  Slightly easier moves lead up to the safety of the big horizontal crack at 25 feet, followed by a few more feet of easy ground.  The opening sequences feel like the physical crux, but you get off the deck real quick on this thing and the moves continue to be committing.  Very heady, keep it togetha!"
My Heart Grew Wings Under Desert Skies,4,vertical,face,"A fine boulder problem with a stiff start, a nice rest and an exciting finish.      Start with pockets down low under the giant, obvious hueco.  Use pockets and edges to make a couple stout moves to gain the jug in the giant hueco (crux).  Move up on edges and jugs to the topout.  Don't pull too hard above the big hueco, as the holds may be loose, some are hollow and it's fairly high."
Wills Arete,5,vertical,technical,"Move easily up and left toward the arete till the pockets run out. Paw at the arete with your left hand and set your feet to bust the big move to the sidepull way up and around the arete. A couple more insecure moves gains a good horizontal and easier climbing to the top. Problem would get 3 stars if it was not squeezed in a corner making you feel like you're going to hit stuff if you blow it, though you shouldn't hit anything."
Mister Witty,6,vertical,technical,A great problem that leads you into temptation.    Start with hands in good pockets.   Rock up and over left with a tricky move to gain a thin flake for the left hand.   Balance your way up the wall to gain the small slots.    With fingers in the slots launch for the good lip.
Every Color You Are,6,overhanging,dyno,Crouch start on the left side of the prow.   Follow good finger pockets to a long move to gain a good hold above the lip.   Match on this and traverse right passing a deep slot/crack.   Continue right with a hard sequence of moves to pull up and right to gain the good deep flake.       Finish direct.
Morning Dove White,7,overhanging,traverse,"Pockets.  Start on the lowest pockets just right of the vertical seam.  Traverse left on pockets, then up to a hard move to and from a bad crimp, and continue up to the horizontal crack and easier ground."
Less Poetry Please,8,overhanging,traverse,A stellar traverse.  Start on the right side of the wall under 'My Heart Grew Wings...' and traverse left on pockets to finish up on 'Wills' Arete'.  Very pumpy.  Feels like a 5.13 route for sure.
Therapy,7,overhanging,steep,"A cool roof problem (the right most problem on the lower roof, closest to the Desert Sky area).  Sit start on pockets and make some pulls to the sharp crimp at the lip.  Some toe hook jezzery on the large jug to the right can make the lip moves feel easier.  Exit left following the seam.  A bit sharp and pumpy, but great moves."
Toxic Avenger,9,overhanging,dyno,A short offset seam/rail on immaculate rock make this a classic.  Sit start low on the rail and crimp out to a big move to the lip.
Bubba: The Legend,10,overhanging,traverse,Starting at the same pockets as for Mr. Happy. Traverse left on a few pockets and stretch to the offset rail and finish as for Toxic Avenger.
Bubba Lobotomy,12,overhanging,traverse,"A right to left traverse starting at Hit the High Hard One, Sit. Pull off the ground with difficulty and make hard sustained pocket moves past Mr. Happy all the way into a potentially heart breaking finish on the Toxic Avenger dyno. A full value line for those that must take it a step further than just Toxic Avenger."
Not The Clapper,1,vertical,face,"Sit start with hand on good holds.   Move up to the left trending rail and following it left and up.    Make a hard move to gain hidden holds on the lip, and then continue directly to finish."
The Clapper,6,vertical,face,"The crux is going to be moving off of teh wide slopy pinch which can be done with either hand. Somewhat contrived in that the scoop of Pig Pen is off, so stick to the arete and holds to the right. May be easier for those with big hands and a long reach to gain the sloper at the top."
Standing Ovation,7,vertical,face,Sit start at the Horizontal as per the Clapper. Move right on crimps to top out at the finish of Not the Clapper.
Paper Crane,8,overhanging,steep,"A neo-classic on bullet rock.  A bit on the short side, but packs a punch.  Sds on pockets, make a long pull, right, to the arete and then employ your own personal kung-fu to stick the top."
Highbrow,7,overhanging,steep,Some would say it's the best problem at the Happies.  Find the fin of rock jutting out of the west rim at a gnarly attitude just above 'Hair Trigger' and near 'Work is a Four Letter Word'.      Start low and climb out the steep arete to a gripping lip encounter which requires you to control a swing and your thoughts about the landing zone.
Unnamed,4,overhanging,steep,"Sit Start on the left undercling move up and right using a crimp and two finger pocket eventually reaching a good but sharp pocket, Top out to the right!"
Sabres of Paradise,7,overhanging,traverse,"My vote for best traverse at the Happies.  Very diverse.  Start on the chalkstone and head left, exiting at the far left of the wall before the crack/alcove.      The beginning offers steep gym-like moves, while the end sports a pumpy crux going through a scoop feature.  This is a popular after work training route for a lot of Bish locals.  Feels more 5.13- than V7.  Climbable in the summer in the evenings, though you should probably be climbing somewhere else..."
Rene,5,overhanging,technical,"Definitely one of the best highballs in the area!     Start at the center of the back wall. Move up to the deep hueco and here is where the fun begins....make some really committing moves on TINY pockets. Crux feels like the scary move you have to make to the lip.     The climb is well worth it, once you get back on the ground!"
DB's Top Shelf,7,overhanging,dyno,On the far right side of the Hand to Hand Combat wall there is a steeply overhanging prow and here lies one of the best Dyno problems in perhaps all of Bishop. Yeah its that good. It may look improbable at first and the landing isn't great but this thing is the real deal. Start on pockets and choose good feet if you can't see the lip you're on the right problem. This thing is massive. Somehow grow the courage and huck for the lip. Use every bit of energy you have to hold the nearly horizontal swing. Mantel and celebrate. It takes alot of strength and power to pull this one off. Are you up for the challenge?    Grading is unconfirmed and it looks like static beta is plausible but realistically this is a solid v7 Dyno. A link up of Hand to Hand Combat into this Dyno is still waiting to be done at around V9.
Not Another Brit in Bishop,7,overhanging,dyno,"Bear-hug your way up this line, culminating in a toss from a good RH crimp to a jug. Cool grips, easy to spot."
Hamtaro,7,overhanging,face,"Starts near the end of Hand to Hand Combat, to the right of the crack.  SDS on obvious pockets and go straight up the prow utilizing a very thin crimp.  Presumably, everyting to the left of the crack is off.  Could be a touch soft for V8."
Powis Traverse,6,vertical,traverse,"Sit start with right hand in the good pocket. Pull up onto the arete and start traversing rightwards.   As you go right the footholds become poorer, with the crux sequence getting to the good starting crimps of the direct problem.    From the crimps move up the wall direct to finish."
The French Connection,6,vertical,technical,Start in the middle of the wall and using pockets get established on the hanging slab.    As the pockets run out seek out small crimps and using these make progress up the wall to the bomber lip.
Size Matters,3,overhanging,mantle,"This may be short, but it packs a punch - the name give a big clue t the problem.    Sit start with hands in low pockets then move up with a huge move to gain a good hold for the right hand.   From here mantle up onto the slab to finish."
Wavy Gravy Direct,3,overhanging,face,Sit Start.   Make a stiff pull on small crimps to get standing on the wall.    Climb directly to finish on the last hold of Wavy Gravy.
Slap Happy,3,overhanging,steep,Crouch start with both hands on the good hold.    Start with difficulty and make a couple of hard pulls until good bucket holds above the overhang can be reached.   From here finish easily above.
Problem A,3,vertical,face,Although this problem is squeezed between Guidebook Writer's Love-In and Viva Dead Mules it climbs really well and arguably has the best movement of any of the problems on the wall.    Start at the large hueco and make fingery pulls up and left to gain two small side pulls. With the side pulls at hand make committing crux moves up to gain good holds at 15 feet. Continue more easily direct to the top.
T-Crack Left,1,vertical,crack,"A unique and mellow high line for the high-baller.      Stand-start on slanting edges down and right of the crack and make a move up left to gain the crack.  Climb the crack with great finger-locks (crux) to the rest at the ""Intersection"" at 18 feet.  Traverse left in the crack and move straight up on good holds when the crack ends.  Take care topping out."
T-Crack Right,1,vertical,crack,"Just as good as it's twin but with a longer traverse and more air under your feet.    Stand-start on the slanting edges and move up left into the finger crack.  Climb the crack with good locks (crux) to the good rest at the ""Intersection"" at 18 feet.  Traverse right for 12 feet on good holds in the secure rail and exit around the arete."
Ketron Classic,4,overhanging,dyno,"Start low on sidepulls, do a move or two up to the left-hand undercling and make a big stretch to a big right-hand sloper.  From here use either the intermediate left-hand crimp, or dyno for the bucket with your left hand (crux).  Top out with jugs.     Good movement, great fun."
Carrot Top,3,overhanging,traverse,Start at the same good flake as Sucker Punch.    Traverse right on good incuts until possible to move up the blunt arete.   Make hard moves to top out the arete.
Grindrite,3,overhanging,steep,Standing start at a good right hand hold.   Pull up onto the rock into an immediately strenuous position.   Make a few hard pulls up left then right to gain better holds and the spectacular horn like protrusion.    Finish more easily up and left.
Slave to the Grind,9,overhanging,steep,"Start seated further right on a good sidepull with a left heel hook on a low ledge and, with some amazing & challenging moves between decent holds, link up with the V3.     There is a video on the web of someone starting it halfway in on an undercling calling it V10, but it is not that hard and starts further right."
The Pursuit of Wow,0,slab,face,Start up of the block onto the slab.  Climb good pockets until the deep finger crack is reached.   Follow this until its end then straight up to finish.    One of the best of the grade around.
Classique,0,vertical,face,Climb directly up the middle of the wall on large pockets.
Banana-rang Delight,5,overhanging,dyno,Sit down start on the good rail center cave. Place feet on a diagonal edge and make a committing dyno directly to the undercling bulge directly above and finish direct on decent slopers.     Requires accuracy to properly catch the dyno and power to hold the feet cut. Fun!
The Flying Zebra,4,overhanging,traverse,"A variation of Serengeti. Start on the ""undercling/sidepull fin"" on the left side of the face. This problem skips the crux crimps of Serengeti by traversing right into the pocket at the base of the Africa flake."
Serengeti,5,overhanging,steep,A brilliant line and one of the best moderates in the canyon.    Start on the undercling/sidepull fin on the left side of the overhanging face.  Move up and right on sloped dishes up to a move off a high left-hand crimp to a sloper (crux).  Gain the 'Africa Flake' (jugs/rest) and find nice positive pockets and edges to the top as the angle eases off.
Burning Rubber Necklace,4,overhanging,traverse,"A nice low traverse.    Start low on the funky jugs on the right side of the small cave.  Traverse left on good slopers and jugs staying low, making a couple cruxy moves with a crimp and good footwork, then head up and left to the big shelf."
Karma,6,overhanging,steep,"The obvious line up the overhanging flat prow on the right side of the alcove. Start with both hands in the horizontal crack between the lower boulder and the upper prow. Reach up and left to a shallow pocket. Heel hook and Slap up to the lip and then go left to a jug and then to the top on more good holds. A direct finish is also possible, maybe a bit easier. Going right and then up the corner and then finishing on the direct line is easier, maybe V4/V5."
Hematoma,6,vertical,face,"Climb the face via small, but good edges.    The landing is flat, but I'd recommend spotters and a few pads."
Slight Inducement,1,overhanging,steep,Sit start at the good hold.   Climb up the steep arete on excellent holds.
Son of Claudius Rufus,5,overhanging,traverse,Traverse slopey lip from right to left. Mantle top-out or turn the corner to top-out.
Super Froz,9,overhanging,traverse,Start down and right as for Son of Claudius Rufus and traverse the lip from right to left using lots of heel hooks. When you get to the corner down climb Safesufer and drop into the start of Froz. Finish Froz pumped and make a desperate throw for the left arete. Very satisfying. A superb traverse!
Sexual Camel,2,vertical,dyno,Climb the right hand side of the face that is to the left of Cleopatra on somewhat awkward moves at first. Work up the face and make a reach/jump to a good jug covered in lichen. Rock over and out. Pretty damn fun and not as easy as it looks.
the_sphinx,2,vertical,face,Climb the globe-shaped face left of Cleopatra
Tunnel Vision,2,slab,technical,Tunnel Vision ascends a solid slab on very small and shallow two finger pockets. Cool holds and a good challenge. Worth seeking out.
Tin Man,4,vertical,technical,"The first move after pulling off the ground might take some heart. Move up to a series of extremely small but positive crimps, including one that might be the most perfect crimp at the Happy Boulders.    I would appreciate feedback on the grade. Thanks!  vimeo.com/82058457"
Cleopatra,5,vertical,face,"This striking prow is found on the West Rim directly across the canyon from the Top Gun area. Look for a triangular wall with an orb on top. Cleopatra is just right of this. Start with good pockets and go directly up the rounded corner using left hand side pulls, and more pockets and then left to the top. Classic moves and very clean. A sit start looks possible."
Squeeze Job,6,vertical,technical,"A blunt arete that starts with a high left hand and a small crimp for the right. DO NOT PULL ON THE UNDERCLING! Hug the arete and heel hook, maybe. Cool bump moves, a long reach to a mono, a sketchy top-out. Go finish it.     It is unclimbed and the grade is not confirmed. I would love someone to go get it done. Please feel free to change the name and let me know the grade."
Bigs Cafe,6,vertical,technical,"A tall wall that starts with some really hard, awkward moves above a roof and follows  some side pulls and small holds to the top. It has been rappelled and cleaned (mostly) last year, I also built a platform for pads. It is unclimbed and the grade is not confirmed. I would love someone to go get it done. Please feel free to change the name and let me know the grade. This could be pretty hard."
Hard Crack,2,vertical,crack,"A fine crack climb, thin hands. Listed as the only route here in the book at V4."
Fingercrack,0,vertical,crack,Fingerlock or layback the thinner crack in the corner of this area.
Mothership Connection,4,overhanging,crack,From the block move into a horizontal crack with your right and get a good jam so that you can reach way out over the lip onto the face and some good holds. Some toe cams in the crack ease the transition to the overhanging face. Fun big moves on good holds take you up the face to the top. The worst part about the problem is that at times you feel like you could barndoor right into the boulder next to you.
Cream Horn,4,overhanging,crack,"Climb the off-width crack squeezing past the Chef boulder at one point.  The landing becomes better up higher.    The grade is a guess -- Kevin suggested 5.11/5.12, which for an off-width is going to be nastier than the V0 suggested in the Bishop guide.    This is one of the prouder crack problems in Bishop."
Mr. Mackey,7,overhanging,mantle,"Start on the obvious underclings under the lip with the crack behind you.  Pull on (not that easy), and slap for the lip.  Traverse the lip left, slightly until you can mantle over.  Some people top out right, but this is not the original topout (variation)      On the normal topout there is a high micro-crimp for the right hand that allows you to flip the left into a mantle.    This is a great problem worth seeking out."
The Ninth Wave,9,overhanging,traverse,"Start low on the lip on a flat ""shelf."" Traverse the lip leftwards to meet up with and finish as for Mr. Mackey. Pumpy!  If you top out early, before you move past the wide crack at your back, you are cheating the full reward of difficulty.  In other words, the grade isn't soft, you are ;)    This climb was first listed in the Dr. Topo guide as ""The Ninth Wave"" and was established by Chris Nuttycombe.  Later, others called it different names.  This is an often overlooked problem and the rock quality is immaculate. Deserves more traffic.    The ultimate project is the link up of this problem into Mecha-Streisand. That would be a mecha-classic enduro problem."
Aquatic Hitchiker,10,overhanging,steep,Start with a left hand crimp on the roof and right hand on a pinch on the other side of the wall. Pull on and place your left heel above your left hand. Make a few moves and finish on the jug of Beefy Gecko. The back wall is not used.
Beefcake,10,overhanging,steep,"Start underclinging the roof with feet on the back wall and follow the left-most rail system out the roof, breaking hard left to exit.  Head for the light!  It is considered bad form to use the ""3rd rock"" when exiting.  Don't dab -- you can do it if you put your mind to it..."
Chizam SDS,10,overhanging,steep,Sit start with a very low right sidepull and a low left crimp.  get a tricky left heel near the hand. and crank left up to the side pull then upwards.  Powerful and often thought to be hard for the grade.
Beefy Gecko,11,overhanging,traverse,"A Hybrid link-up.  Start as for Beefcake, but when you get to the ""jug,""  head rightwards to end as for Windchill (drop-off).  The big hold as you traverse right that allows for a wrist-cam/handjam is off.  It's an eliminate I suppose, but you'd be using the other boulder to use that hold anyway.  Use the obvious crimp instead.  Pumpy."
Rorschach Test,11,overhanging,technical,A crimping piece de resistance.  Start low on some crimps and continue crimping up and right to a long move out to the arete. Get your crimp on!
The Aquarium,12,overhanging,steep,"Do you like overhanging compression problems? Then this guy might be for you.    Start as for Aquatic Hitchhiker and make some hard moves past the pocket to the jug finish of the problem.    Instead of dropping off, take some deep breaths and climb leftwards on decent rails, and make your way across the cave and top-out around the corner as for Beefcake.    This full value line will most likely pump you out and punt you off going to a jug near the finish.     Remember to breath, and shaking out on the jug finish of Aquatic Hitchhiker could prove useful.    There is a direct finish for Aquatic Hitchhiker as well, but it has a terrifying finish."
Beautiful Gecko,12,overhanging,steep,Start on the undercling feature just right of the start of Beefcake with feet on the back wall.  Follow the middle rail leftwards to join Beefcake at the jug.  Finish as for Beefcake.      This problem has changed quite a bit since the first ascent with several major breakages thus upping the grade.  Powerful climbing.
Strength in Numbers (Original SIN),5,overhanging,dyno,"One of the best moderates anywhere and one of the best lines in the Tablelands - featuring fun dynamic moves with a steep, explosive start and an exciting finish.  This boulder problem embodies quality movement, and is an undisputed area classic that should be at the top of your to-do list.     Sit-start on the large obvious twin-hueco underclings.  Make a big move straight up to the gaping hueco, then style your way up and left to the good right-facing edges that lead to the rest on the good jug/sidepull.  A couple large moves up and left between crimps on the lip will get it done."
Thug is life,7,overhanging,steep,"Same start as for S.I.N. trends right after the first hueco and takes the prow line for sustained thuggy movement to a hard sequence befor the finish jug, easy topout. I dont know if this has been done before so please correct on FA or Grade."
China Doll,0,vertical,face,"Climb the pretty and inviting rib feature on the boulder left of Molly, on huge holds. Careful of some flaky rock at the top."
Molly Dyno,4,overhanging,dyno,"Use the two obvious good pockets around head height to make one huge move to the finishing jug of Molly. The grade is a filler, difficulty will be highly height- and dyno-ability-dependent."
Molly,5,overhanging,dyno,"Sit-start on low pockets, make a couple easy moves in more pockets then stretch up high to the left-hand sidepull.  Pull up to the crimp in the horizontal seam or throw for the lip (crux).    Height-dependent"
Garden Pest,0,slab,face,Climb the slabby wall via good incuts and crimps.
Fire Pit,2,vertical,face,Climb up the arete with a big move to a good hold at mid height.   Continue with a tricky pull to great finishing holds.
The Snapper,5,overhanging,face,Start low and reach up to a good pocket.   From the pocket reach up left to a flake which is followed to a move right and a good undercut flake.    From the flake make the crux move to a good small spike like hold and from here climb directly on up the wall on good hidden holds.
Prozac Nation,2,overhanging,steep,Start below the large horizontal flake.   Climb up the pocketed wall and reach left to gain the flake.    From the flake make a  big move to the pistol grip hold then another over the overhang.    Finish on big holds straight up.
Guantanamera,3,overhanging,technical,"Sds and climb the left arête using the cool blocky pinches and holds.  Very nice rock and one of the best of its grade at the Sads.  Obscure and often overlooked, it is worth seeking out."
Humpty Dumpty,3,overhanging,steep,"Start on a big jug under the roof and climb the short roof to a lip encounter on good patina.  A few of the upper holds are suspect, but hey, it's the tablelands.      Deserves more attention than it gets."
Lawnmower Man,7,overhanging,face,"The crux of this varies depending on height and flexibility. Move up on OK holds to a sprague pocket sidepull with the right and make a huge reach out left to the blunt arete at the lip of the bulge and a good sidepull jug. Make another long pull straight up to a 4 finger slot, if you are very tall you can keep your feet below you, otherwise a high foot out right works. Now hand foot match on the left and pull through to the top."
Los Locos,7,overhanging,traverse,"Work straight up from a blocky starting hold on ""slopey"" jugs to a right sidepull up high. Now the fun begins, traverse left using a hard to find sidepull, not the obvious one, and a series of bad edges with terrible feet, all while staring at the boulder that you could hit if you blew it in a bad way. Finish the hard section with a scary pop to a sloping but well textured hueco. From here continue easily to the top of the boulder."
Satellite Boulder Left,3,vertical,face,"Start on jugs, finish on excitement. Try not to peel into the tree."
Rio's Crack,6,vertical,face,The whole seam portion is the crux. Start with both hands at the bottom on the seam and feet pasted under the bulge and start working the seam and trying to find feet to keep you from sliding back down it. Once you can really establish your feet on the face above the bulge your in. The seam ends at a horizontal and easier moves lead to the top.
Anti-Hero,5,overhanging,steep,"Classic moves: start with your ass way down in the dirt, left hand absurdly low on the arete and right on a good sidepull or undercling. Power out the steep overhang with positive flakes, underclings, kneebars, toehooks, and brute force to slopey-ish holds at the lip, then find the good flake out left to top out easily. This would for sure get four stars except for the extreme dab potential on the rock a few inches below your rear. And it'll probably feel easy at the grade if you do a lot of pullups."
Off the couch & Up the nose,2,overhanging,steep,"go around the left side of the ""nose""   good juggy warm-up, with a decent landing if you have a spotter.    Start at the sit for Overhanging nose, work towards left hueco and make a reach left to an incut finger-jug, bump again about a foot over the roof for a good (but a little sharp) hold with the left hand, bring the right hand to the first hold (that your left hand was just on), next put your feet on the giant block under you and make a long reach to okay holds on top, get your feet up and try to get to the great right hand jug, top out."
Pow Pow,8,overhanging,steep,"Start either sitting or standing and reach out the overhang to do the standard cross-over/under sequence, et al.  Harder if you're shorter.  Requires core.  Really fun.  Git 'er done!"
The Black Stuff,1,vertical,face,"This is a tall and exciting problem on bomb-proof rock. Tricky finding what holds to use, but they're all there. If you fall, make sure it's on the flat-block and not into the pit off right (that would be ugly)."
French Press,6,slab,face,"A very unique problem with impeccable rock.  Mount the scoop and slab it out to the top.  Climbs more like a sandstone problem, on slicker rock, of course.  Classic."
The Groove,0,slab,technical,Climb the groove directly via a series of excellent technical moves.
East Arete,5,vertical,face,"SDS on pockets and using the arete (or not) make the span to a better hold above.  The top is a bit loose, so exercise care.  Very stout, but one of the better moderates at the Sads.  Doesn't get as much traffic as it should."
President Bush,0,slab,face,"Stand start left on the obvious sloper crimps (slimps), move up and right across the good sloper rail using solid finger divots. Optional heel hook out left for the top out. Surprisingly great movement with good landing. Bush not in.  Some say this goes at V1... I doubt it."
The Fang,4,overhanging,steep,Start at the large hole on the left of the cave.  Move up and out towards the lip of the cave.   Using core strength stay on and reach down and right to the fang.    Grab the fang and squirm up it to reach better holds and the top.
Feeding Frenzy,7,overhanging,steep,"Sit start at the large hole on the left.   Climb steeply out the line of holds to make a powerful pull, making use of a so so heel hook on the sharp rail.      Continue pulling hard moving up left to finally finish straight up."
Mr Frosty,8,overhanging,steep,"Start sitting on pockets and make powerful pulls to the left, exiting into the scoop."
Professional Widow,4,overhanging,steep,Climb up to the scoop/hueco and then commit to the exciting crux finish.  Seldom done -- deserves more traffic.  This is one of the best V4s at the Sads.  Sack up and do it!
Slunk,9,overhanging,technical,"The original sds clocked in at about V7 before an undercling snapped off leaving a much harder version.      The full rig is very atypical of tablelands climbing in that it requires subtle hip positioning and clinging reminiscent of font or grit while using much slicker holds.  The rock quality is superb, but the problem is often in the sun and cool, cloudy conditions are optimum.      Definitely worth seeking out."
"Whiskey, Beer and Spliff Hits for Breakfast",4,overhanging,steep,"Start with hands low on good holds.   Pull on get the feet set and crank out the steep face, finishing with a long reach up to the lip of the boulder.    Fun fun fun!"
Give Me A Rim Job,6,overhanging,dyno,Climb the right side of the overhanging prow.  The crux is the dyno to the top.  Sweet problem!
Heelin' It,2,overhanging,technical,"Follow the arete to the top and don't forget to heel it!  The crux is getting positioned into the last heel hook to step up on the last, big (obvious) nub to top out psycho billy. Great arete problem for those psyched to heel ;)."
The Extrapolator,6,overhanging,dyno,A powerful dyno full of tension is followed by hard moves on slopers which then leads to a hard powerful mantel on good rock.    Stand start just left of the corner created by the two rocks. Grab the sandstone like starting rail and pull on with a giant slopey foot hold. Get pitted and fire up to the lip of the boulder. Core up and get a hand foot match before climbing leftwards before the mantel.
Bruiser Boulder,6,vertical,face,"Start at a decent two or three finger pocket high up for right hand, pull to a horizontal and then pockets up right."
Sock Dudes,4,vertical,face,Stand start in the same spot as Knuckle F***er but head up and right to a crescent shaped hold and then up the seam.
The Crown,1,vertical,face,"This beautiful block is the first boulder you see as you approach Hurd Lake. This tall arete is a majestic and beautiful climb. Start low on the good rail and move up to a right hand Gaston(crux) from there use the good crimps to top it out. Not for the faint of heart, and not a climb you want to fall on"
X-Men,4,vertical,technical,"starts on large pinch 6ft up, move up and left on diagonal cracks to thin edges and a grainy arete"
ATF traverse,6,overhanging,traverse,Super fun traverse. Start as far left as possible and traverse as far right as possible before mantling out.
Time Crunch,3,vertical,technical,"This might be one of the most enjoyable climbs I've found so far at Hurd Lake! As far as having cool moves, and a spicy finish.. Sit start with left hand on the arete right hand on the low side-pull. Make your way out to the bigger ledge and throw up a heel. Hit the higher awesome crimp with your left hand get sideways and bump your right and up all the way to the lip!! if your short this might feel much harder than V3 but I'm sure if you use crafty beta you can get the send."
Pepper Jelly,3,overhanging,mantle,One of the best lines at Hurd Lake. Flowing climbing on slightly overhanging rock with good holds and a crux at the very top. Sit start with two hands in the amazing crack seam and work your way up to the crimps underneath the roof. Go for the jugs at the lip and traverse left over a smaller boulder. Take a spoonful of that pepper jelly and bust a heel/toe mantle to the positive holds high above. A must do climb!
Heavenly War Path,3,overhanging,steep,"Take (Heavenly Path) at the Happy Boulders and introduce it to its alpine evil twin (Heavenly War Path). Start off in the crack the same as (Pepper Jelly) make the first couple powerful moves to the jug on the lip of the boulder. Just Like (Heavenly Path) reach up to a right hand crimp on the slab and crank down. Reach for the top and watch your feet, pull over the lip and do a zesty ""I just did that"" dance..."
Ice Troll,4,overhanging,dyno,Sit start with left hand on the arete and right hand on the crimp side-pull. Make your way out to the big ledge and go direct for the sloper at the top(dyno). If you can stick it gather your strength to go for the other sloper and give it all you got to the super positive finish. Epic fun line
Prince Albert,5,slab,traverse,Start on the rail on the arete and work your way right(traverse) across the face. Crux is at the end as you make a big right hand move to a decent rail and top out. A very fun fun line. Get on it early or when the sun is going down.Your gonna want at least 3 pads to protect the fall.
Lean On Me (Sit),5,slab,technical,Sit start variation to (Lean On Me) Use the two granite edges and some fancy footwork to pull yourself up towards the good rail. Get your balance game on rocking over to the slab and reaching for the top! Although this climb is short it has awesome movement and the granite is stunner.
Boz Boz Slab,5,slab,technical,A Boz eh-spe-chi-al. Stand start with right hand on decent crimp on the slab face. Use magical powers to get onto slab reaching for a tiny edge on the face. This is a do what you gotta do kind of climb to get in position. Finish direct to the slopey top-out!
Just Keep Swimming,6,vertical,face,"Start on the right side of the Arete and work your way up. The hands start off with decent holds and soon turns into a combination of good technique and brute strength. A true arete battle, worthy of many burns."
Illmatic,6,overhanging,steep,"A contender for best line at Hurd Lake! Stand start in the cave with a left hand on the really good jug and the right hand on the undercling crimp rail. Find small feet on the roof to lift off the ground and match on the good left hand. From there work your way out of the cave by using smart foot work and core strength. Crux is throwing for a sloper/rail out of the cave from tiny crimps, a really fun move. The top-out is also a beast, all around sick line. Give it a go! A rare granite roof climb, seldom seen in the bishop area."
Hibbity Dibbity,7,slab,technical,"A classic line on a beautiful boulder! Stand start with left hand on the large under-cling rail and right hand on the arete. Use fancy foot beta and find your own way up, once you make some progress get ready for crux 1. Find a good stance and make a move towards a grey solo nob on the face. If you stick the nob get prepared for crux 2 by reaching up high to a decent semi crimp rail and rock on to the slab. Finish on a beautiful highball slab top out, reaching for a large crack past the slopey lip. A must do climb!!"
The Deciever,7,vertical,technical,"This line lives up to its name, once you start pulling you realize your in for some serious burn. Start with left hand on the chest high diagonal crimp rail and right hand low on the good side pull. Use fancy footwork to get through the bottom and towards a higher right hand sidepull/undercling. Once established get ready for a huge lock off reach (which if your short this will feel like V8 or possibly harder)"
Roadside Fire,2,vertical,face,Stand start in the middle of the wall on a small left hand crimp at head hight and a right hand on an orange and white sidepull seam. Climb straight up to top out at the highest point.
Roadside Fire Sit,6,vertical,face,"Sit start directly below the stand, matched on the low undercling. Make your way into the stand and finish it."
Illicit Sweetie,0,slab,face,Climb the left side of the alligator skin face via incut edges and buckets. Once past the start and your feet are established it's just sweet patina plates all the way to the top. Easy descent via incut patina jugs to the right or off the slabby north side of the boulder.
The Sideling,3,slab,traverse,"Start at a good rail 6 or so feet right of the Halfling arete. Traverse left across the blank face using balancy footwork. Keep full-body tension to transition into the arete without barn-dooring, and finish up the Halfling."
Nicole Overhang,6,overhanging,steep,"Stand start with right hand sidepull in the diagonal crack rail, left on crimp out left. Move up and left encountering big moves. Mantle"
Strawberry Contraceptives,7,overhanging,steep,"SDS on the north arete, on good holds. Make steep moves on the overhang, finishing on the arete."
Saxwing on the DL,5,overhanging,face,"Start on a right facing jug rail, gain a high dish hold above and pull a textbook tree topout."
Planet X,6,overhanging,dyno,"One of the all time great dyno problems. Considered by many to be the best boulder problem in JTree. Start off a large cheatstone (although not necessary), climb jugs up to a blank, vertical headwall with thin crimps, to an all out dyno for a huge jug 20 ft. off the deck. Finishes with a few mildly exciting sloper moves."
Jerry's Kids,4,vertical,face,"Start at a thin rail on an eye level bulge, to the right of the center of the Northwest face. Follow thin holds, right, then up better holds to the top."
Up 20,2,vertical,crack,"A fun highball with a scary crux near the top.    Start easily up the thin crack, and gain a good ledge below the widening crack.       Layback the crack for a scary sequence until possible to move into the wide top part of the crack."
All Washed Up,6,overhanging,steep,"The left side of the face, climb obvious small crimps up overhanging rock of excellent quality. At the higher horizontal somewhat larger crimps provide a bit of relief as you figure out how to negotiate the completely blank, rounded topout and get to that jug that's too far away :) Totally awesome problems and reasonably straightforward for the grade compared to some of Joshua Tree's classic ""blank"" nightmares!"
Ample Mantle,1,overhanging,mantle,Jump start to a jug and a great mantle.
Pumping Monzonite,7,overhanging,steep,"This tough J-Tree classic, is found along the interpretive trail roughly opposite the sharp boulder problem South Arete (V0- R). It is found on the backside facing east."
High Heeled Sneakers,5,slab,crack,"This problem is encountered after about  125 yards, when approaching from the parking lot. This is a slick thin crack with a cruxy face at the top. Don't fall! Not much chalk on this one."
Saturday Night Live,4,overhanging,dyno,"This is an entertaining boulder problem 20 yards from the Real Hidden Valley Parking lot.  Park and walk west, as per Loose Lady.  After 5-6 seconds of hiking, look over your right shoulder.  You'll see a big scoop with a chalky handhold on the left.  Grab the hold, smear your feet and dyno to the lip.  Then make an easy mantel to finish the job.    A rating on this one is pretty meaningless..."
Betty Jo Yablonksi,0,vertical,face,"One of 10 or so classic high balls in the Park, as well as one of the easiest, this is the first climbable feature you'll see on your left as you enter the real Hidden valley corridor. Refrain from setting a TR and just go for it as the crux is encountered midway while leaving the top is a feeling to be savored and not feared.     Don't expect to send in a quiet setting as foot traffic is heavy here. That's ok though, more people to hoot as you top out!"
Ceasar's Palace,6,vertical,dyno,"A classic run and jump problem.  The V6 rating is not mine, but has been tossed about.  As far as jump problems go, this one is pretty hard and is probably J2+.  It is harder than the run and jump on Streetcar Named Desire, and miles harder than the Jump Chump.    Start well back from the South, and then sprint headlong at the boulder, trying to launch up and right to the obvious patina rail that is high above.  Finish up and right on easy ground.    Here is a video link to ""The Driver"" trying this problem in the '80's.  fishproducts.com/movies/dri…"
Evan's Problem,4,overhanging,technical,"Sick of sketchy highballs? Tired of polished rock? If you said yes to any of those questions, than this is the climb for you! Start matched on a slopey cresent and slap through shallow dishes before toping out at the apex. Lowball. The adjacent boulder is off."
Kirkatron,5,vertical,traverse,"located on the N/NW face of sports challenge rock, this 30 ft traverse begins on the right side in a wide vertical crack.  move right to left on a variation of hold types and finish at the big flake (Lobster Lieback)"
Turtle Face Center,2,slab,technical,"Climb greasy smears and edges up the center of the West Face, ending just right of the summit point."
Shipwreck,3,overhanging,steep,This is a great arete climb located on the west side of the Shipwreck Boulder. Just look for the obvious arete across the way from So High (V5 R).
Fist Full of Walnuts,3,vertical,crack,"Start way back in the alcove and handrail, jam and stem your way up and into the light and better jams near the lip. Finish by turning the corner and making an easy mantle to finish. Descend by downclimbing Down with the Ship, the problem just left of where the problem tops out."
The Button High,3,vertical,face,"A cool circus move from the left facing jug sets you up on the face.  Move left towards the ""buttons"" with a couple of reachy moves.  Continue up and left to the summit.  Hard move are getting established on the face.  Scary moves are moving left."
So High,5,overhanging,face,Start off a cheatstone and follow the patina flakes up the slightly overhanging crack. Make some committing moves going over the top onto the upper slab.
Powerband West,8,overhanging,traverse,"This is the traverse under So High. Starts on low sidepulls and traverses right. It used to connect with So High, but some holds broke."
So High (sit),11,overhanging,face,SDS.  start below and a few feet left of the So High start.  pull through crimps to join So High.(holds continue to break)
Black Velvet,2,vertical,technical,"Starts from the left via a mantle (harder) or from edges slightly right and then climbs the high-angled slab with thin, delicate and balancy moves off the deck. It's possible to use the arete on the right making this slightly easier but the pure line is straight up the slab. The easiest descent is to downclimb the southwest arete and then step off (or jump) onto the flat boulder adjacent to this boulder."
Jump Chump,2,overhanging,dyno,"This run-and-jump problem, of which Joshua Tree has many, uses the concave face below to lauch for the huge patina plate which beckons high above the desert floor. Plan your take-off carefully and then fly upward to an easy topout. Credit John Long for the vision to see this entertaining diversion."
Act of Contrition,3,slab,technical,This climbs the inside arete to the right of the split on the south side of the boulder.
Dish Mantel,2,overhanging,mantle,"Per the Miramontes guidebook: ""Jump and mantel the obvious dish."" The guidebook has it at V2/3."
Pigpen,4,overhanging,crack,"Behind Cyclops rock is this awesome boulder problem. A sit start in a cave starts you out 10' of finger crack through the roof in the cave, to a tight-hands swing around the lip and then fingers, off fingers and tight hands lead to a funky top out that is for many the crux."
Intuition,4,overhanging,steep,No text - use the 'Improve This Page' link to add something useful!
The Yogi Variation,8,overhanging,steep,Start as for Pigpen. From the bucket rest bust out to the arete and power up pinches and slopers to the lip and throw out left to a good hold. Top out on some slopey goodness.
Off Camber,4,overhanging,mantle,"This problem lies on the north face of the Manx Boulder directly behind a dying tree. Start at the obvious sloping ledge and make a big move to gain the lip, then press out a mantel with tree branches at your back (a little scary) to complete the problem.     UPDATE: Tree gone since 2007 or so."
Unnamed,2,slab,technical,Start at a sloper on a blunt arete and climb the slab with balancey moves and small handholds.  The Miramontes guidebook has it at V2.
Unnamed,3,vertical,face,"Sit start underneath the boulder in the same place as for Sitting Bull. Instead of going left as for Sitting Bull, go right to a high sidepull, then up."
Peabrain,4,vertical,crack,Pull into the undercut finger crack/seam and work your feet up as you lieback your way along this technical and enticing problem. Not a highball but exciting enough near the top with your feet pasted high. Quality.
Mighty Dog,7,vertical,face,"Refer to picture topo under Pea Brain V4.  There is also a sit-start from good obvious holds under Pea Brain, traversing right into Mighty Dog. Not sure of the grade."
Pick your poison,2,slab,technical,"Sit start using two good opposing crimp rails and good edges for feet, span up and right toward two thin but solid crimps. Utilizing a good rail under the crimps (easiest beta, but pick your poison *giggity* ) work your feet up until you can mantle onto the slab to your right. Slab stroll to the top!  Established: Nate Pierce FA: Danny Kommel"
Orange Julius,7,overhanging,face,"Start in overhanging huecoish terrain to gain small crimps at the bottom of the dike. Pull a straightforward but powerful, reachy sequence on tweaky edges with little to no feet. Once your feet are established on the dike, the difficulty eases.     Favors tall climbers. At 5'9"" I was campusing between edges through the crux."
Brief Squeeze,1,vertical,technical,"Start on a bad pinch and sloper, go straight up to prow, and top out."
Caveman,6,overhanging,steep,"Start by climbing an adjacent boulder on the right side of the cave to access the huge starting jugs, traverse left on STEEEP jugs with bad feet to a cruXy low spot in the roof, finishing up fins and jugs. Downclimb and step off to finish at either the highest jug or at the furthest jug to the left.    Traversing high at the start and utilizing the ""hidden"" hold, this problem might be V6, traversing low at the start is probably more like V7, avoiding the ""hidden"" hold is even a bit harder (IMO more esthetic). I think this problem deserves AT LEAST 1 star, prolly 2 because of the uniqueness of the climbing involved.    The sit starts low on the far right of the cave at a pinch and a sloping undercling, about 10 feet below the regular start. Crumbly starting holds have made this start harder over the years. Consensus is that it is a fairly solid V10, holding on for nearly 25 moves being the business."
Stem Gem,4,slab,technical,"Located in a small group of campsites on the Southern end of the Blob formation. Please ask permission for bouldering in occupied campsites.    Stem Gem is the Quintessencial JTree boulder problem, embodying the essence of Joshua Tree climbing: Highly technical and often times perplexing movement across extremely friction dependant, featurless granite. Indeed, this problem has nary a hold on it, the only thing making it climbable is its coarse friction and the undulating nature of the stone.    Getting both feet off the ground on this problem can be an event in itself, bringing ones flexability and stemming prowess to task. Start by stemming up the concave face and then traversing right across a faint/blunt arete. Most continue right and stand on the ""bump"", however it is possible to avoid the bump and friction direct (v3 friction in itself), continue up the water groove and to the top of the boulder. Jump across boulder to get off."
Stem Gem Mantle,5,slab,mantle,A pure mantle on a lone sloper.  This problem continues to get harder all the time due to erosion at the base and feet from Stem Gem ascentionists wearing down the hold.  Pressing this one out in butterfly form just might be the highlight in your mantle career.
Mumbles Mumblephone,4,vertical,technical,"Start on two crimps over the lip of an arete, pull up and right to a tiny crimp work your way up on crimps and slopers till you hit a huge sloping rail then top out. Very balancy and extremely sandbagged. Very fun problem."
Black Pea,2,slab,technical,Climb the slab past the namesake “Black Pea” feature.
Pinhead,0,vertical,crack,This 15' blockish boulder is located approximately 100 yards from the pit toilet at the end of the back loop of Hidden Valley Campground along obvious trail.  Several excellent problems exist.  Pinhead follows the prominent fingertip crack along the west face.  Fingerlocks up crack and mantle to top.  Downclimb east face.
The Funktion,3,slab,face,"A tall, classy old-school boulder problem. Start via either a dynamic move to a crimp or perhaps from cheater stones if present. A few big, fun lockoff moves lead past a rail and on to better holds further and further above a rather dicey landing. The topout isn't too perplexing, but it does involve a little slab at the very top and you're pretty far off the deck."
Scatterbrain,6,overhanging,technical,"Start from a high incut edge and slap, pinch and heel hook your way up the overhung arete to a finishing jug. Classic.  A sit start has more recently been done at around V11."
Mystical Vibrations,5,overhanging,steep,"Sit start under the roof on a killer hueco, chuck to a big shelf, then power over the rounded arete. Down climb the slightly scary slab."
The Palmist,3,slab,technical,Stem up the concave.
Slugs of War,2,vertical,face,"A decent little boulder problem. Stand start with your hands on the large sloping ledge, then use a classic dish w/ thumb catch and some other bad holds to make it to the lip.  Sit start is awkward But fun and goes at the same grade.   (Starting right foot is crumbly but should get better with traffic)"
Bonum Vitae,7,overhanging,traverse,Start down low and to the left. Traverse rail diagonally up and right.
Bittersweet,9,overhanging,mantle,"Start on a low, crimpy rail down right and bust core intensive moves left on good flat slots, eventually gaining a nice edge/flake, from there move up and left to a technical mantle."
Thin Lizzie,8,overhanging,dyno,"Start on the jug rail at the bottom of the face in the middle of the overhang/roof. Make huge move to small 3 finger crimp, then dyno to a gaston, and dyno to a jug."
Chuckawalla 'Yabo' Start,6,overhanging,steep,"Yabo sit start as you would for Little Chucky, but instead of moving out right, move left and straight up the boulder. Strenuous gaston move out to the left makes this more difficult if you're shorter."
Relic,9,overhanging,technical,"SDS at the southwest arete, move right and past the overhanging northeast arete of Tidal Wave at twin sidepulls and then traverse the smooth patina face using thin edges, sidepulls and creative body positioning to reach the Bedrock Arete  which is taken to the top.    As an alternative it can be done from a stand start at the Tidal Wave arete using a flat edge on the left side of the arete and sidepulls on the right (this is the version described in the bouldering guide) which makes it slightly shorter and perhaps a little easier."
Tidal Wave,10,overhanging,technical,"This line takes the northeast arete of the boulder. Two good holds at about head height, one on each side of the arete, will get you started. From there, horrible left hands on dimples and texture (calling them ""holds"" is kinda laughable), some heel trickery, and positive but well spaced right hands will take you to the summit. Probably the most do-able of the problems at this grade in JT, reachy but not too morpho. Due to the minute, sloping nature of half the holds, you'll want cold temps."
White Rastafarian,2,overhanging,steep,"This problem is located on a large boulder at the Southeast end of Rock Hudson. Climb a juggy crack on an overhanging arete until it dies out 15 ft. up. Lean out left, onto the overhanging face, to a large flake. Finishes with an easy mantel 25 ft. off the deck. One of JTree's finest problems."
Roof Romp,4,overhanging,steep,Crux is getting to some behind-the-head crimps under the roof. Fun little problem.
Reverse Romp,4,overhanging,face,"Sit start as for Flake Direct and climb up to the start of the flake. Break left, and reverse the moves on Roof Romp, continuing past the traditional start until you reach the chossy corner."
How's Your Mama?,4,vertical,mantle,"This problem starts a few feet over from the left arete on nasty crimps and polished feet, gaining the right slanting seam and following it until you can mantle over the top. Getting established on the face from the ground is a battle in itself. Taller people will find this easier than short folks."
Pitch Two,4,overhanging,mantle,"This problem is found above the sit down flake (V2) on the second tier of the Dino's Egg boulder.     Start with a good left sloper and an in-cut right hand using the positive rail on the underbelly (see picture).  Move to a sloper and head towards the jug above the lip, finishing with a not-a-gimme mantel (see picture).  Squamish style and a bit thuggy."
False Hueco Traverse,2,overhanging,traverse,"SDS.  Start as for False Hueco, but traverse right.  good heel hooks move you quickly.  crux at the end."
Falser Hueco Traverse,2,overhanging,traverse,"The jug rail has fallen! Without the rail 2/3 of the way through the problem, the problem is a good bit harder. Smaller holds and more difficult movement will take you through to the finish. The loss of the rail significantly altered the problem and has left it more consistent in difficulty.    Can we get a consensus on the grade?"
Yabba Dabba Don't,3,overhanging,dyno,"After easy moves to a big jug in a left leaning diagonal crack, this problem involves an exciting and committing diagonal dyno to an exceptionally large, black xenolith. The landing drops away at a sloping angle into a pile of big cobbles, but can be made fairly safe with a couple of pads."
Hobbit Hole Offwidth,0,vertical,crack,"The obvious splitter offwidth. Gets wider as you go! Either climb it straight in like a man, or lieback it like a sissy. (I took the sissy way.) Same grade either way, but much more strenuous to jam it straight in."
Scorpion Traverse,4,overhanging,traverse,"Sit start and traverse right on good huecos.   At the right side of the cave move out to the lip and make a hard move to gain good holds in a slanting crack.       Follow the crack past a break until possible to move left into a scoop.   The crack is not hard, but you feel exposed as you make your way higher.  From the scoop either traverse left and downclimb onto the boulder, or continue directly up."
Scorpion Roof Direct,5,overhanging,steep,Sit start as for Scorpion Traverse.    Move out to the lip of the roof.   From the lip make a hard move to gain a poor sidepull for your left hand.    Bear down and reach up to the slopers at the horizontal break.   It takes power to keep hold of the slopers as you match and traverse right into the crack.    Reach the crack and take a breather before finishing as for Scorpion Traverse.
Tilt-o-Meter Traverse,1,overhanging,traverse,"Traverse the Tilt-o-Meter boulder by climbing through the three Tilt-o-Meter problems.  You can start from the right and move left, or you can start from the left and move right--they go at about the same grade.    If starting on the right: Start at the top of Tilt-o-Meter Right standing on the shelf and move down onto the rail (basically doing the climb in reverse), then hit the jugs on Tilt-o-Meter Center by making use of the large flake, then climb Tilt-o-Meter Left and top out.    If starting on the left: Start at the left-most hold higher up on Tilt-o-Meter Left, move down and right to the large flake, move up to the jugs on Tilt-o-Meter Center, then move to the rail of Tilt-o-Meter Right and finish on the shelf with an easy mantel."
Gripped and Grunged,4,overhanging,traverse,"Start at the pointed knob, then traverse the dike to a jug."
Animal,6,vertical,face,"Start with a sidepull and pinch. Work up to another pinch, then pull onto the slab."
Roasted and Raw,12,overhanging,steep,"SDS as far back under the roof as you can and climb a tricky sequence to a jug at the lip of the roof (Raw, V8 starts here) and finish up the technical face to the top."
Chili Sauce (aka Moffat Problem),7,vertical,technical,"Chili Sauce is a fairly obvious dihedral on a boulder that lies near the right side of the formation on the desert floor.    Climb a short, overhanging dihedral with sweet diagonal rails and stems. Move out left to a pockety seam and a diamond shaped black diorite edge. Power through the crimpy crux to a jug over the top."
Corner Arete,1,slab,technical,"Old school V1.  Get established on thin slabby feet on the face to the left of the arete. Make a committing lunge right to the edge of the arete. Find small edges and smears for feet on the slab face, and decent slopers on the arete for hands as you ascend. Make another committing throw/lunge from the steep arete to the lip to top out.  Downclimb Riff Raff or Wannabe"
Facet Arete,6,slab,technical,"Start leaning off the right side of the arete, find your feet and power up to better holds above."
Dreaming of the Master,8,vertical,crack,Lieback a difficult right-leaning crack over a bulge on the South Face.
Swinging Richard,4,slab,traverse,Start at the southwest corner of the boulder with both hands matched on a large incut jug and then traverse out left via an overhanging rail that requires some creative footwork and reaches. Finish up the arete or by turning the corner onto the north face and up a slab (easier).
Miledi,3,vertical,face,"This superb problem is found in the center of the north face and features excellent grey stone throughout it's length. Lieback a right-facing flake to about two-thirds height, make some committing moves to get stood up on the top of the flake and then ease your way to the top - the ground is a long ways down at this point!    The base is flat but sloping so you might want to terrace your pads to level it out. A sit start can be done which adds a few more moves and bumps the grade up to V5."
K.D. Supreme,4,overhanging,steep,This brilliant problem features some of the better rock in the Park and is well worth a visit.     Start with your left hand in a vertical seam and your right hand underclinging a small overlap then work up to good incut jugs on a smooth face. Get your feet high and power up over a small roof to some nice incut holds. Once above the roof good holds lead to the topout. A sit start can also be done and checks in at around V6.
Miledi (yabo),5,vertical,steep,"start on small crimp and undercling, fire into the starting flakes of Miledi"
K.D. Supreme (yabo),6,vertical,face,"yabo start at incut slots, gain the vertical slot and undercling at the start of K.D. Supreme"
The Embryo,4,slab,technical,This problem is on the side facing away from the road. Move up a right diagonal rail to steming up a concave face.
Block Problem,0,slab,face,"On the main face, left of The Trough (5.0) and Karpkwitz (5.6) is a thin white dike cutting up a face. Pull onto really nice edges of the dike. Care is required topping out due to the height, but jugs abound."
Locker's Face,1,overhanging,face,"Just right of Locker's Chimney is a fantastic face climb that gently overhangs. Starts on small crimps and work to a jug where you can shake out before committing.  Physical crux is low, mental crux is high where you swing out into the crack and top-out.  I personally felt like this was an absolutely fantastic climb and I'm surprised it's not better known. It's hard for the grade (even for JTree)."
Mr. Freeze,5,vertical,face,Thin face just right of Butterfly crack.  Joins that route around the 20 foot mark
Leather and Lace,5,slab,face,"Start with hands on the two obvious holds about 5 feet up to the left of the chimney.   Climb up the left leaning seam with finger powerful pulls to the crux moves to gain the slab, which is followed to the top."
Dream Sequence,6,overhanging,steep,"Sit start and compress the double aretes, climbing up and left following the lip of the boulder, ending at a large dish above the overhang, then mantel."
Slashface,3,vertical,face,"Another of Joshua Tree's finest boulder problems, this ascends the center of a beautiful vertical face peppered with juggy slashes. The crux is encountered fairly low on the problem, leaving many airy jugs to be savored. The problem tops out at around 25 ft. with an easy, yet committing mantel."
Tips Be Gone Traverse,7,overhanging,traverse,Crouch start as for Tips Be Gone.   After the move up left continue traversing left on good hand holds.   When these run out launch up left to small but positive holds in the holes up and left.    Continue left on improving holds to finish.
Pinched Loaf,6,overhanging,steep,"Power up the shallow, overhanging left-facing corner past a prominent, rounded black knob and a slanting lip. Short but demanding."
3-Star Lieback,0,overhanging,crack,"Beautiful lieback flake.  Slightly tall (tops out at 20-25 feet).  Lieback section up to about 18-20 feet, pull up onto ledge on top of the flake, traverse/walk the ledge left to follow the crack, and hop up another few feet to the summit.  Downclimb is a super easy and safe walk down the backside of the boulder.  Super fun, and aesthetically pleasing problem."
4-Star Dyno,6,overhanging,dyno,"Start at a head-height rail, paste a high foot, and dyno up to a good hold about 6' away. Finish up on jugs/flakes."
The Peanut,7,vertical,face,Start as low as possible and climb the highball face trending left over the boulder. Scary!
Dripper Left,2,slab,technical,"Start at a right-slanting flake and then stem and contort your way up and left until able to reach into the bottom of a widening flake. The crux is controlling the swing as you commit to the flake but shorter climbers may disagree with that. Once established in the flake make a few airy moves and mantle over on jugs. A short bit of easy but exposed face leads to the top. Quality.    Downclimb by heading to the left and then down a slab with some knobs which will get you onto the shelf above Driblet, where a quick hand traverse and final easy corner will get you to the ground (see photo)."
Dike Face,5,vertical,face,Don't look at the chalk as it's very misleading. Jugs up to a left hand sloper. Skip the second sloper and do a big move left handed up to a crystal. Right hand to the bad sidepull and the rest is easy. Don't fall topping out.     Downclimb either Cleavage or a gritty 5.6 fistcrack on the back (south) side.
Cave Rock Problem,4,overhanging,steep,Obvious and fun cave/roof feature on Cave Rock.
Scum Bag,8,overhanging,steep,SDS. Beta intensive and sustained. Slightly overhanging with solid beautiful features. Landing is so comfy you could sleep there (...with a JT back-country pass of course).
Palm-o-Granite,6,slab,technical,"This challenging and balancy problem climbs the rounded arete/corner right of Joker (V1) via creative body positioning as you work the rounded, sloping holds until near the top where you can rock over and finish onto the slab.     Due to the sloping nature of the holds this problem is best done when the temps are cool and your hands are in shape for pulling on the rough rock - caveat emptor!       Still cleaning up a little so don't be surprised if a little loose grit is present."
Picture Perfect (sit),5,overhanging,steep,"Start with a good crimp for the right hand, and a poor one for the left.    Pull up and get a good edge for the right and then reach up for the starting holds on Picture Perfect.       With both hands pinching the arete reach up for the better holds above."
Finger Fetish,8,overhanging,steep,Begins on an incut rail under the roof on the left-most end of the boulder. Exits the roof on crimps and continues up the tall slab to finish.
Fry Problem,2,vertical,technical,"Start with a high pinch/lieback and smooth, undercut feet, pull into the rock and use creative body english to reach some high sloping edges. Bust left to a good edge, then stem and reach for a sculpted jug and on to the juggy top.  Downclimb the juggy crack just right to descend."
Spud Fry,3,vertical,technical,Starts with both hands matched on the furthest sloper hold to the right of the “Spud Crack.”  Move left on pinches/side pulls with technical foot placements. The crux is the left shoulder/gaston move into the start hold of the classic “Fry Problem.”
Alexandria,6,vertical,face,"Yet another of Joshua Trees most beautiful boulder problems, Alexandria, which follows a crescent shaped Aplite dike of superb quality, and ascends a dead vertical face that rises 23 ft., climbing nearly 20 ft. of absolutely perfect edges.    Jump start to a 1 inch deep rail that is about 9ft. up, above a cave-like area. Angle around left and up on immaculate tile smooth rails, up to a royal crown of Jugs. The start has also been done static, pulling off razor thin crimps, done this way it is V9.    This problem, as well as the others on this boulder were all FA'd ground up, no pre-inspection, no pre-cleaning."
Psyche,4,overhanging,steep,"Climbs a stunning black, overhanging arete with big moves between slick slopers and a ""psych"" topout. Fire through big triangular slopers, up and left to a rail and a juggy flake. Commit to the psyche move and topout on black fins. The topout is about 20 ft. up with a sandy landing.    Also has a sit/traverse called Xenolithic var. or Quickstone, is prolly V5. Sit start on the left side of the small cave at an undercling, traverse right about 6 ft. on slopes and small crimps to the first triangle sloper. Finish up Psyche."
Streetcar Named Desire,6,overhanging,technical,"The obvious dihedral found several hundred feet East of Gunsmoke. Ascends a shallow dihedral of coarse Jtree monzogranite with increasingly difficult and technical stemming moves, up to a small roof cap that guards a juggy sloper above it. Some mantel to the left, some mantel to the right.    The run-n-jump is prolly V5"
The Chube,2,overhanging,dyno,"If Gunsmoke is too crowded, play on this for awhile.  Located about 50 yards to the left of Gunsmoke as you face it (NE I think); path leads the way.    Nice right slanting finger crack ends a boulderer's throw from the top.  Have a good spotter just in case.  If you top out, they can move the pad to the back for the jump-off . . ."
Iron Resolution,12,overhanging,steep,"A few years ago a large chunk of rock fell out of the hillside behind Streetcar Named Desire during a rainstorm. What used to comprise a .12a sport route and two cracks including Enter the Dragon (.9) and Fists of Fury (.10a) is now a very tall and very difficult boulder problem. It climbs a sweeping, beautiful, 45 degree marbled brown face to a lip and then a thin, glassy, lower angled rust-colored face to a finish 20-25 feet off the desert floor."
Gunsmoke,3,vertical,traverse,"Classic.  Like Yosemite's Midnight Lightning, Hueco Tank's Ghetto Simulator or Boulder's Monkey Traverse, Gunsmoke requires little introduction.    The Gunsmoke Traverse is L-shaped and is usually done from left to right.  Start as far left as possible, move right along the wall for about 50' past 2 crux sections, turn the corner (third crux), and continue another 35' along rails to a final bulge.  If your guns aren't too smoked, reverse your moves back to the start.      GUNSMOKE IS LIKELY THE SINGLE MOST CROWDED ROUTE IN THE PARK, and it's not uncommon to find a dozen or more people there at any given time.  Several other quality problems can be found in the vicinity, including the classic stemming problem Streetcar Named Desire (V6) and The Chube (V2).  Southern exposure makes this a hot one during mid-day - best done in the late afternoon."
High Noon,5,vertical,crack,"A vertical, flaring crack that rises 15 ft. above the center of the Gunsmoke traverse.    Climb juggy rails up to a vertical crack with a big move to the sloping lip. An easy mantel gets you onto the ledge, ending the problem. Walk off the ramp to the left."
Shanghai Noon,6,vertical,dyno,"Begin on low jugs somewhere left of High Noon on Gunsmoke Traverse. Make a dynamic move to the jug at the beginning of High Noon, then climb left on the rail and up the face above via edges; crux move is a throw to/pull from a sloper and is more difficult than High Noon. Not sure of ""exact"" location of start; can be done from the beginning of Gunsmoke, as can High Noon. Thinner top-out as well, if I remember correctly."
Sex Magician,7,overhanging,traverse,"This traverses the left side of the roof. Start from jugs on the left and traverse right, finishing with a crack."
King Cobra,8,vertical,technical,No real crux... if i had to say the start was the hardest... but its more about commitment. Def. High Ball
Diary of a Dope Fiend,8,overhanging,steep,"This problem is a super classic, and perhaps the best problem of its grade in Joshua Tree. Essentially Caveman's big, secluded brother. Climb the sustained roof on jams, edges and heel hooks with a dynamic finish on sloper slapping. Some trickery allows you to completely recover before launching into the final sequence. The plastic-trained climber who loves gymnastic moves on relatively large holds will adore this one."
New Wave,5,vertical,traverse,"Start at the obvious high crimps.    Move up left and make a long reach to a good sloper for the left.    From here traverse powerfully rightwards, either on poor slopers, or powerful crimps.    Make a hard move to gain good holds just left of Old Wave, and then finish easily straight up to the left of Old Wave."
Native Arete,0,vertical,face,Climbs the prominent arete formed by a protruding dyke.    A good problem on funky holds.
Native Arete SDS,1,vertical,face,Extending an excellent problem to make an equally good problem and more sustained problem.    Sit start facing left and climb the arete directly to join Native Arete.
Lost and Found,8,vertical,face,"start low, at an incut rail on the right side of the problem, move left and up on thin rails. choose one of several possible powerful sequences to get you to a dark rail. make a large move to a jug and continue up the grainy jug rail to a slopey but easy topout, could be a bad fall here"
JBMFP,5,vertical,technical,"This classic problem takes a proud line directly up the middle of the large boulder near False Up 20 (V0-), and sits directly across the road from Double Cross. Depending on how tall you are there are a few different starting holds, but thin holds are the name of the game on this problem. Don't breath too hard as you might blow yourself off the crux, but as you hit that last hold with your right hand, rest assured that the final throw for the lip might look far but that hold is huge!"
Yabo Roof,3,overhanging,mantle,SDS.  throw to the lip and do the sweet mantel
Yabo Roof Traverse,6,overhanging,traverse,"Sit start at crack slots, traverse left 10 feet, then mantel the same as yabo roof"
False Up 20,0,vertical,crack,"Around and left from the JBMFP Boulder is a massive boulder, the largest in the area, with a striking lieback flake on it's north face.  Solid moves on this the whole way, but it gets pretty high and, pads or no pads, falling is probably best avoided. Four stars out of five."
Western Roll (sit),5,vertical,face,Start below the side pull for Western Roll.  Use the wide rail to get off the ground.  A small crimp for your right hand gets you up and to the start of Western Roll.
Penguins in Bondage,4,overhanging,steep,"Power up the overhanging arete on mostly positive flakes, plates and a unique triangular hole in the patina to jugs up high. A good spot is helpful on this problem."
Sloper Safari,4,overhanging,mantle,"SDS at a low shelf and work up and slightly right on horizontals to the crux move, a long reach to a two-handed slot, before making another reach and and mantling over the sloping top. FYI - unlike the guidebook description the crux is down low unless you're mantelly-challenged.     Short but really fun climbing on mostly jugs with a definite crux."
Meadows Direct,6,overhanging,steep,"Sit start under the overhang with hands on two good holds.    Make a long reach to the good slot then hold the swing as you get established below the next long move.    Make another long move to the good break, then finish rightwards and mantel."
Alien Arete,5,vertical,technical,Obvious arête on the first big boulder on the North side of the whole formation.
Lynn Hill Memorial Face Problem,4,vertical,technical,"Climb sidepulls and thin ledges to a horizontal rail about 3/4 up.  From here, the crux requires a left gaston on a small crystal and some balance.  Exit up and right."
Iron Meteorite (aka Kingpin),5,overhanging,steep,Climb juggy patina plates and edges up a bulging face to about two-thirds height where the rock changes color and the holds get much smaller and worse. Work your feet up as high as possible as you hold onto sloping grains and aim for a visible depression at the lip. Downclimb off the backside.
Igneous Ambiance,7,overhanging,steep,"Start at low horn and jug, pull powerful moves leading to a large move to a perfect uncut rail, traverse slightly left and up to gain high plated jugs."
Mulligan Variation,8,overhanging,face,"Sit start at the two horns, climb the right side of the arête."
Classic Thin Crack,2,vertical,crack,"This short boulder crack is on a south facing boulder about 100' left of ""Fun Stuff"". Climb the right-leaning crack in the middle of the face.    From the parking lot, a sign marks a short trail to this problem."
Coyote Corner,1,overhanging,steep,"This climbs an under-cut corner and roof to jugs, on the NW side of the formation.   Climb the corner passing the roof on the right. Follow jugs to the top."
Monkeyflower,3,overhanging,dyno,"On your way to Land of the Lost check out this funky number. Yabo start a low jug on smears and throw for nice incut, move right and mount up for a throw to a jug, mantle. Reminded me of Craig Fry for the interesting heel hook beta (hint, hint!)"
Chorizo Tacos,4,overhanging,traverse,"SDS lower left on edge rail, work right along seam/crack to join chorizo taco stand then finish on that route."
Master Cylinder,5,slab,technical,"Match start on the low rail, power up and then left on tricky slopers to the arete. Finish up the smooth tall slab. Sandy flat landing."
Spicy T,0,vertical,dyno,Sit start on the boulder at the base of the crack. Follow the crack up and left until the positive holds run out. Throw around the corner to a nice edge then cut feet and swing left to exit on the ramp.
Bodyglove,4,overhanging,technical,start at the body and soul arete and stem your way up and out to the jug lip. thoroughly entertaining!
Tinkerbell's Anus,2,slab,face,"SDS at jugs and work out right and then back left onto the smooth brown slab using nice but sharp incut edges and the occasional pocket, the largest being called "" Tinkerbell's Anus"". Interesting moves on great rock."
Lox O' Kourndoggs,3,overhanging,traverse,This is a traverse right from the 'Tosspint' start hold. Traverse right to small crimpy flakes topping out on the shelf on the right of the arete
Habanero,4,overhanging,traverse,"Work up thin, slick edges to an undercut horizontal crack then traverse right and up past a shelf or go big for the top. Tricky for the grade."
Kentucky Fried Christ,2,overhanging,crack,"Start on the rail down and let, move up right through roof and along horizontal crack to a vertical crack. Lay this crack back and top it out. Long and fun with crux moves low."
The Inquisition,6,overhanging,crack,"Start 10 feet under roof In wide crack, Climb the flaring offwidth to the top"
EJ Deluxe Escape,3,vertical,face,Same as EJ Deluxe but escape left.
EJ Deluxe,5,vertical,face,In the center of the face move right on a rail then head up and left passing a shallow corner.
Feeling Lucky,3,overhanging,steep,Stand start on good crimps. Pull up and slightly right on crimps and side pulls. Steep moves to the top.
Mr Nice,4,vertical,traverse,Sit start to the left at the beginning of the upward rising dike feature. Hand traverse the dike to the top.
Double Entendre,6,overhanging,steep,Sit start on the low rail. Figure out how to get to the next rail 4 ft. away
Animal Crackers,5,overhanging,dyno,"V5/6 boulder problem. In my opinion, harder than JBMFP but not as hard as Scatterbrains or All Washed up.   Sit start on the ground with two undercling/side pull flakes. Throw up to a right hand sloper, move left into a circular pocket, and throw big to a V0 mantle above."
Machine World,3,overhanging,traverse,An awesome boulder traverse on the northeast side of Puppy Dome. Great for laps and building forearm endurance. Many ways to get through the crux slopey section. Start on two heavily chalked jugs in a small cave and start working right. Have fun!
Machine World Extension,6,overhanging,traverse,"There are several ways to start and extend the classic Machine World.  Here, I’ve described what I believe is the most popular and aesthetic variation to the problem."
Snake Eyes,3,vertical,face,"Stand start at the horizontal crack/rail and make a big move out left to a pair of ""snake eye"" knobs."
Double Dyno,3,overhanging,dyno,"Sit start on good holds down and right of the Kauk problem, underneath the overhang. Make a dyno straight up to another set of good holds, reset the feet and dyno again up and right for the shelf. Mantel and top out."
Kauk Problem,5,overhanging,technical,Start on a horizontal crack/rail and climb up the knobby lip using tiny crimps and heel hooks. Taller people may have a harder time. Sit start is V6.
Eliminator Traverse,7,overhanging,traverse,Start on the right side of the face next to adjacent boulder. Traverse left along the horizontal crack and into Kauk Problem.
Right Scoop,0,vertical,face,Right side of the scooped face. Climb the corner on the right side of the scoop.
Left Scoop,0,vertical,face,Ascend the arete at the left side of the scoop.
Skywalker,1,vertical,face,"Ascends the tall face on the north side of the Scoop Boulder. This sea of knobs is super-fun, but just a 'little' scary.    There is a slightly harder variation a few few right (I called it V3 back in my sandbagger days)."
Unnamed,1,vertical,traverse,Traverse the angled seam left to right across the north face of the Scoop Boulder.
The Scoop,3,vertical,face,"Curved, orange, knob-covered face visible from the road."
Creek Arete,0,vertical,face,One of the oldest and most popular problems in Tuolumne.
Golden Rastafarian,3,overhanging,mantle,"This problem is remarkably similar to the White Rasta in Joshua Tree in both difficulty and style of moves, but it is not nearly as scary. Start standing on the left side of the arete and make powerful and technical layaway moves up the arete until it is possible to grab the top of the boulder at about 15'. Mantel over with some difficulty. The crux of this one is getting off the ground but it is exciting all the way through the mantel."
Golden Rastafarian Sit Start,6,overhanging,steep,"Sit start at the base of the arete, make a couple of difficult moves to get off the ground, and then climb Golden Rastafarian."
The Tombstone,2,vertical,face,A tall problem that climbs the obvious left arete of the east face of the tombstone boulder. This problem eases significantly after the first half.
Cellulite Eliminator Stand Start,5,vertical,face,Stand Start on crimp rail and move right and up . Same finish as Cellulite Eliminator.
Cellulite Eliminator,7,overhanging,steep,Sit start under the roof. Make a hard move to get past the roof and climb slightly right and up. V5 if you stand start above the roof.
Steelfingers Traverse,8,overhanging,traverse,"A super classic traverse problem. A 40 foot left to right traverse that goes through a series of slopers, crimps, heel hooks, horizontals, underpalms and cracks. The typical beta at the start of the crux is to get a left heel, toe and lock off to a sloper crimp above the roof."
Fists of Glory,0,vertical,crack,"Sit start with a hand, pull up into fists. Beached whale finish. Sit start might make it V1  Absolutely perfect splitter"
Pumpmaster Traverse,2,overhanging,traverse,"A long traverse of several continuous horizontal cracks. Start a few feet right of Mean Green and traverse right on the obvious lip, through an alcove, and around a corner onto the western aspect of the wall. Keep going right as the lip turns to a crack, and at some point drop down to  lower horizontal cracks. Continue through a steep cruxy section with underclings and sidepull flakes, pull up again to slopers, and continue across a thin slabby section and all the way right until you reach an obvious stopping point at a ledgy broken area. It's pumpy!"
Mean Green,8,overhanging,mantle,A classic problem up a gently overhanging green face with many horizontal slashes. Sit start at the block on the lower right side of the face. Pull on and move up and left through the multitude of sloping horizontal slashes to a cruxy mantel high off the deck.
The Arete,4,vertical,face,Sit start low on obvious jugs and follow the natural line up the west face of the boulder. Either go straight up on knobs or out right on rails to top out. Grade stays the same either way.
Unnamed V5,5,vertical,face,"A nice Gunks problem.  Start on the big right undercling and small lefthand hold immediately left of the undercling.  Get high feet and climb up using crimps, slopers, and knobs.  Various options exist toward the top, but they don't really affect the grade."
Bachar Mantel,3,overhanging,mantle,Around the right corner from Thunderbird are two knobs on the tallest part of the sloper rail. These are the holds for the Bachar Mantel. Grab the right hold and make your way to the left or jump start. Mantel over and follow the easy slab to the top.
Cerwin's Mantel,8,overhanging,mantle,"Rad mantel to the right of the Bachar Mantel. Start with hands on the lip and mantel your guts out. Love these techy gems! It is given a single star in Barrett's guide, but I think it is actually excellent."
Galaxy 5000,10,overhanging,dyno,"Starts on low crimps to the left of Thunderbird, then follow left holds up to a decent crimp. Head out right to a small crimp and then dyno for the bucket out right. Continue into the top of Thunderbird to make it Thunderhead, or drop off for the regular finish."
Thunderhead,11,overhanging,traverse,"Climb Galaxy 5000 to the end, then continue rightwards into the rail section and topout of Thunderbird."
Thunderbird,11,overhanging,technical,"Thunderbird is to Tuolumne what Midnight Lightning or Mandala are to the Valley/Milks.  This may be THE classic Tuolumne test piece.  The crux sequence begins after you gain the first crimp, meaning everyone and their uncle touches this problem. The bottom crimps can get slippery as a result.    Start on the low sloping rail and move left to a couple of mediocre crimps.  Do a big throw to a sharp but slightly incut crimper flake followed by a couple of easy crimping sequences on decent hands/feet.  Core up to the sloper rail, mantle said rail, and don't biff the easy 5th class slab to the top.    There's also a left variation called Thunderhead which holds the same grade.  Thunderbird seems the physically harder of the two (though I personally have not sent Thunderhead)."
The Gallery,0,overhanging,mantle,Sit start with hands on good in-cut holds.   Climb the wall trending leftwards to finish with an airy mantle.
The Gallery - Low Right Start,4,overhanging,traverse,"Sit start down to the right of the original sit start.  Move up to a good in-cut hold, then make a hard traverse leftwards to gain the good rail holds on The Gallery.   Finish as for The Gallery."
J.B.'s Corner,4,slab,technical,"Sit start at jugs in the corner and perform some baffling, magical stemming moves to get established on the slab above.  The slab is tall and it is common to traverse right after the stemming sequence."
"The Gallery, Left",4,slab,technical,"This is a nice, harder variation to the Gallery -- something of an eliminate, but a classic one.  Sit start as for the Gallery, but instead of pouncing up and right to a big edge, go out slightly left on tiny edges and gastons before rejoining the Gallery at the big jug rail.  Top out as for the Gallery."
J.B.'s Arete,5,slab,technical,Climb the arete and then top out (or traverse off) as for Bachar's Corner.
Out of your league,9,vertical,face,Start with left hand crimp head height and right hand gaston crimp over head. Big first move to mellow topout.
Matador,5,overhanging,steep,Compression moves up the blunt arete. Start with the large sidepull rail for your left hand and a small pinch for your right. Make your way to the good hold in the middle and top out using knobs.
Texas Radio,3,vertical,technical,Really good and fun highball. Stand start on the face just left of the arete. Climb up with some tricky foot sequences and then eventually grabbing the arete. Top out with care.
Reach for a Peach,6,overhanging,steep,Steep arete on the South corner of the boulder. Sit-start to upgrade to a V8.
Reach for a Peach Low Start,8,overhanging,steep,Start slightly lower on a left hand pinch on the arete and right hand on a crimp. Make a hard move to get into the regular start.
The Cube,0,vertical,crack,A great crack/arete climb on the Eastern corner of the boulder.
Flakes,1,vertical,face,Start on the East Corner and follow the flakes up and right.
Cube Face,2,vertical,face,"On the Northeast face of the cube, look for the large flake in the middle of the face that leads to an obvious jug a the top. A reachy start leads to climbing the flake with thin feet. When the flake dies out, make a committing move to the jug on a hidden left hand."
Olmsted Crack,1,vertical,crack,Splitter hand crack up a tall boulder. Aesthetically pleasing.
Back Breaker Roof,3,overhanging,crack,The most prominent feature on this crack bouldering cliff is the imposing Back Breaker Roof OW crack in the center.
Ament Arete,6,vertical,technical,Sit start and climb the left arete. Stand start is v4.
Ghetto Snake,5,overhanging,crack,"A 25' rattly fist to cupped hands, roof-crack boulder problem. The crux lies at about the 15 foot mark, and the crack never gets more than four feet off the ground.     Unless you have big fists, the only solid jams are about a foot deep in the crack. In my opinion, this is one of the best crack problems in the park. WAY worth the hike (and drive if your coming from the valley)."
Olmsted OW,4,overhanging,crack,The crux seems to be turning the lip of the OW roof using classic left-side in traditional arm bars. Heavy on the tape and extra clothes.
The Roof,4,overhanging,mantle,"Hard and steep is the game, with a slightly involved lip mantle."
Solar Flare,4,overhanging,face,"Looking at the side that faces 120. Starting at an obvious rail, go up and right. Ending at the jug."
Solar Power,6,overhanging,mantle,"Stand start with a right-hand sidepull crack, left hand on a black xeno. Move out left to an edge, then up along the lip of the boulder to a textbook mantle (same topout as Solar Flare). Sit start is V9."
Lost in Conness-templation,0,overhanging,crack,Find a beautiful right leaning crack on the main face of the boulder. Climb up and traverse right on gigantic jugs until a topout becomes easy.
Short Train,4,overhanging,steep,Same juggy start as Lost But Not Forgotten V8 but goes up left into the V3. A nice overhanging climb with jugs to finish.
"Lost, But Not Forgotten",8,overhanging,steep,"Start low on jugs underneath the roof, following more jugs out and left until encountering some small crimps which lead out right. Make some hard moves to a good knob-jug at the lip for an easy topout."
""" Fear and Loathing In Tuolumne""",9,overhanging,steep,Start Same as Lost But not. then head left to Weasel Tooth Hold. One Move Wonder.
Unnamed,3,overhanging,steep,Start in the undercling that forms one part of the larg X on the right side of the boulder.  Climb up into the small hole then either up and right for a V3 exit or go straight up for a V4 exit.  See overview photo for a topo
TKO,7,overhanging,steep,"Start matched on the sloper under the arete.  Climb left out the rail until you can reach some crimps in the middle of the steep face, then the lip and topout"
G23 Arete,6,overhanging,technical,"Almost as classic as Jedi Jake, G23 Arete features equally good edges at the start to a crimpy arete sequence that leads to jugs at the top.  Start crossed on the two left-facing sidepull edges at the bottom of the arete. After a long move  out right, find a way to reach the holds on the arete and top out."
Jedi Jake,7,vertical,technical,This is one of the best V7's I've pulled on in Tuolumne and is most likely the main draw to visitors of the Campground Boulders.   Start low with a left edge and a right hand on the arete. Make a few moves on perfect crimps until a bigger move to the large left hand sidepull at the bottom of the rail. The V5 stand starts here. Follow the rail up to better holds and topout on jugs to the left (same topout at G23 Arete).
Four Horsemen,7,overhanging,technical,"Four Horsemen climbs the aesthetic, overhanging arete on generally good holds that get better the higher you go. The problem starts on the lowest slopey undercling for the right hand and a low small crimp for the left. There seems to be a number of ways to do this problem but most feature dynamic compression moves on crimps and slopers."
"""Heavy Artilery""",9,overhanging,traverse,Start on Art of War Finish just left of Hand Grenade. V7 from slopping Rail.
Sticky Bomb,9,overhanging,face,"From Hand Grenade start, climb straight into the final grips of Charlie Couldn't Do It climbing through a sloper and bypassing the detour moves on Heavy Charlie."
"""Pansy Tank""",10,overhanging,face,Start on Art of War Finish on Hand Grenade.
Heavy Direct,12,overhanging,face,"A direct version Heavy Charlie. Start as Art of War, climb into Sticky Bomb."
Ian's Prow,6,overhanging,steep,Sit start on low holds and make your up the arete. Classic Tuolumne style with positive holds and a knobby topout.
For the Glory,7,overhanging,steep,"Incredible movement up a steep wall on generally positive holds. Start low on a flat hold. The climb can be broken down into two sections: the first, reaching the sloper jug using a mix of sidepulls and underclings, and the second; climbing the rail above to good topout holds. A bit scary but awesome."
White Stuff,7,overhanging,face,"Another standout V7 in Tuolumne. Start on good holds low on the rail. Work up and left, reach for the crimp, and grab the sloper on the lip. Good holds await to make the topout casual."
Spaceballs,4,vertical,face,"Start on the lowest jug possible in the middle of the wall, with a sidepull for your right hand. Make your way up through the knobs."
Booze Bottle,6,overhanging,steep,"Hard, powerful moves on high quality rock make this a must-do problem for those that can make the grade. Start standing at the top of the right-facing rail with good holds. Use the ""Booze Bottle"" pinch to get from the rail to the arete and continue up to a relatively mellow topout. The sit start stays pretty shady but the holds on the arete go into the sun around noon."
Booze Cruise,7,overhanging,technical,"From the same stand-start as Booze Bottle, head up and left on crimps until you can gain the rail and top out.  The rail will start going into the sun around noon."
Booze Bottle Sit,8,overhanging,steep,The sit to Booze Bottle. Start with a left hand crimp and right on the rail. One or two hard moves will take you to the stand start.
Booze Cruise Sit,8,overhanging,steep,The sit to Booze Cruise. Start with a left hand crimp and right on the rail. One or two hard moves will take you to the stand start.
Heart of Darkness,9,overhanging,face,Start on a good jug near the left side of the east face and climb straight up on crimps.
Bachar Cracker,4,overhanging,crack,This crack climb is probably one of the most awesome boulder problems ever!  Short walk from the campsites in Camp4 and has a bit of a rocky landing so you might want more than 1 pad.  A super classic boulder problem!!  Sit start deep at the base of the crack on a jug and climb straight out!
The Rebirthing,0,overhanging,crack,It starts at one side of Two MASSIVE boulders and horizontally offwidths for a long way until you exit to a wicked stemming problem and cranks out to a hand jam and up over the lip.
The Robbins Problem,3,slab,face,Start on the right facing feature. Climb up and left and finish up the mossy slab.
Bates Problem,4,overhanging,technical,"This is a mega classic V4 that doesn't see much traffic for some reason. It is located on the Big Columbia Boulder, just around the corner from Midnight Lightning.    Start to the right of the tree and a right facing corner (the corner is ""off""). With an undercling and a big glassy foothold for your right foot, reach up and left to an angled edge. Get a high right foot above the lip and rock over to another gaston. Reach up to a jug and then climb easy terrain to the top. Although tall, this problem isn't really a highball. Once you reach the jug, it's 5.7 on big features all the way to the top. But it's a different story if the moss is wet!    To get down either downclimb the problem to the jug and drop off, or downclimb the tree to the lowest branch and drop off. If you're dropping from the tree, have someone bring a pad over or else it's kind of an ankle bruiser."
Midnight Lightning,8,overhanging,mantle,"What can you say about such a classic boulder problem that can possibly do it justice? First sent by Ron Kauk who worked it for over two months in 1978 with fellow hardman John Bachar, this line up the Columbia Boulder stands as a true milestone in modern rock climbing.  People have rated this from V7 to V9, and if you can't mantle it's going to feel downright impossible.  Start on the series of polished opening crimps, fire a right hand up to a good undercling crimp, move the left hand up, and then get ready to fly out to the Lightning Bolt hold with your feet kicking in the air (although if you're over 6ft. or so it can be done as a static move). The bottom moves are powerful but it's the infamous mantle that will throw most suitors back down into the dust. Trust your spotter and believe..."
After Midnight,10,overhanging,steep,"The line to the left of the mega classic Midnight Lightning was christened by Jerry Moffatt as After Midnight in 1993.  It's height will require mortals to want a toprope, yet it is technically on a boulder.  It was originally graded 7c+.      The first ropeless ascent goes to the highball master Jason Kehl in the 2000's.  If you are feeling bold and desire a ropeless ascent, bring plenty of pads."
The Moffat Start,10,overhanging,traverse,Jump start to an angled sloper. Traverse left to the mantel of Midnight Lightning.
Duck-Hit Traverse,1,vertical,traverse,"Hard start moves on right edge, then traverse left and climb up left edge/arete."
Blue Suede Shoes,5,slab,technical,"Climb the slab just left of the featured VB descent. Extremely dependent on your footwork to start. It gets slightly easier higher up with dime edge crimps that you can actually use. Keep climbing on the crimps until you reach the very top, don't bail and finish on Red Suede Shoes."
Red Suede Shoes,6,slab,technical,Start off from the left to the start of Blue Suede Shoes. The crux is the first 3 steps. You'll find relatively positive holds from middle of the wall.
Thriller,9,overhanging,technical,This is one of the more classic camp 4 problems. Not as sand bagged or as high as midnight lightning but a little more crimpy. Defiantly my favorite Yosemite problem. Avoid the crimps to the upper left of the boulder as they are not part of the route.
The Force,9,overhanging,face,This problem starts on the obvious Thriller crimp start and goes out left. The Crimps are small but the feet are positive which makes the climb a good bit easier then Thriller.
The Titanic,5,overhanging,dyno,"The namesake problem of the boulder is a difficult one (or two) move wonder.  Start standing on the right side of the gigantic jug.  Make a big move up to a right-hand sidepull, control it, then move up and slightly left to top out."
Battle of the Bulge,6,overhanging,face,start on jug rail and negotiate your way up the bulge. Great fun!
Marco's Traverse,1,vertical,traverse,"Traverse right along the face of the Goodrich Boulder using large edges, jugs, and underclings before toping out. Top out is easy and the landing is very safe."
Initial Friction,1,slab,technical,This smoothly cleaved slab is exciting and aesthetic. Expect typical polished Yos slab work. Another cool weather problem.
Tendons Give,4,overhanging,traverse,"Sit start far left on the arete. Traverse right to a tricky crux, dropping down on to a jug. Recover, and pull fun moves along good rails to top out at the highest point of the boulder."
Cocaine Corner,5,overhanging,dyno,"This technical arete/face is one of the all-time classics on the Camp 4 circuit. Slap, pinch, layaway, smear, highstep and edge your way up to an insecure crux involving a weight transfer or foot dyno just before the top. A very sequential cool weather problem that sees plenty of suitors, but few ascents considering the rating."
Tendon Technique,5,overhanging,technical,Start from the ground and slap up the side using a combination of toes / heels. Keep shuffling your hands along the sloppers at the top until you eventually join and finish on the rails of Tendons Give.
Wine Traverse,0,overhanging,traverse,"On the south side of the boulder. Moves left and up through deceptively good holds.    According to legend, this was done by the Bird while carrying a jug of wine. Hence the name of the boulder."
Donini Problem,0,vertical,face,Climbs up through a series of liebacks. The crux is somewhat high.
Dominator,12,overhanging,steep,Climbs the roof left of Cave Corner.
Woodward Arete,4,slab,technical,Climb the slabby arete closest to the trail.
Torque Spanner,8,overhanging,steep,Start matched on jug rail under roof-throw out to slopey lip and maneuver out right to a good horn. Hold the foot cut and top out. Requires core tension and length doesn't hurt.
Shiver Me Timbers,5,overhanging,face,Start on high jugs. Climb left to the arête and then up. Highball and scary. Don't fall after the jug.
Bruce Lee,8,overhanging,technical,Stand start and climb the arete starting from the left side. You may need to stack a couple pads to get off the ground.
Kor Problem,3,vertical,technical,A techy face climb on good edges. Stand start just left of the tree and climb up and left in the tan streak
The Font Problem,6,overhanging,steep,"Climb the bulge from a stand start. An SDS is possible, and goes at V7."
Sex Factor X,9,vertical,face,"Start with a high right hand sidepull crimp. Climb up to an angled jug, then continue up and back left."
Kauk Slab,7,slab,technical,"A perfectly cleaved smooth friction face with visible starting feet and then a few bare hints of something you might call edges or holds. It is significantly harder than Blue or Red Suede shoes. Extremely temp dependent, with paper thin edges in a couple of spots. If you can send this one, you'll likely do well on Kumba - the other notable hard slab on the Camp 4 Circuit."
Hammerhead,5,vertical,technical,Delicate moves. Climb the right side of arete.
The Thief's Dyno,4,overhanging,dyno,"A nice, straightforward dyno problem near Honor Among Thieves.  Stand start with good crimps, paste a foot, and huck for the lip.  A great problem for dyno connoisseurs visiting Yosemite.  This is unnamed #25 in Matt Wilder's SuperTopo guidebook."
Delicate Flower,6,overhanging,dyno,A nice dyno problem just left of Honor Among Thieves.  Start standing on the right side of the rail and pounce for good holds.
Honor Among Thieves,9,overhanging,technical,"Climb the appealing, overhanging arete from a sit start with technical and powerful movement.  The problem is V7 from the stand start."
Circuit Breaker,2,slab,crack,"This is one of the classic crack boulder problems in the Valley. Approximately 20' tall with a short approach, flat landing, and easy walk off, this slightly leaning splitter finger crack is great for honing your thin fingercrack technique. Mostly first knuckle locks. Usually bouldered, but you could rig a TR if desired.  ""Climb the beautiful splitter finger crack that angles up and left. First 5 feet are the hardest by far."" - ShaunG Gregg"
Buckwheat,4,slab,technical,"Great, slabby, egdy problem.  Worth a stop, don't let the V4 rating fool you, it becomes a very technical and awkward problem if your on the shorter side."
New Delhi Freight Train,4,overhanging,mantle,"This is a pretty good and seemingly overlooked problem in the Curry boulders.    Stand start with two good, right-facing sidepulls (the higher of which is incut and about head-height) and make difficult moves to poor holds at the lip of the boulder.  Pull the lip and execute a fairly easy (but still droppable!) mantel to gain big holds near the top.    The SuperTopo guidebook gives this problem V4.  I felt it was a touch harder than most other V4s in Yosemite, though YMMV."
The Angler,3,overhanging,face,Sitting on diagonal crimps move left and up.
Root Canal,7,overhanging,face,Not your typical Yosemite Valley boulder problem.  More similar to something you might find in Bishop or elsewhere.  High step into the corner and pull hard on small crimps.  Make some cool moves up the corner and go for the jug/top of the boulder to finish.
Zorro,4,overhanging,dyno,"Start on angled rail, moving right towards a to side pull/under-cling. Throw for a jug up high."
Curry Hurries,1,slab,face,"This is a fantastic High ball with the cruxes coming right off the ground, and also about 10 feet up, but its not over until you are standing on top."
Imodium Podium,3,slab,technical,Start in the dihedral to the climbers left of curry hurries and go straight up to join the left side of the highball arete. If you bail right to curry hurries you are off route and to scared to finish this thing as it is cruxy and insecure way up off the deck.
Barrel of Laughs,6,overhanging,mantle,"Climbs better than it looks. Sit start at a large undercling. Make a few moves on opposing side pulls and climb left toward the arete. High step right foot and rock over to reach the slopey lip. Easier if you're tall > 5' 9"". Hard if you're short like me (5' 7"").    A bit committing with a potentially bad landing and a scary mantel at the lip."
Crossroads Moe,6,overhanging,dyno,"Start at a left facing rail, make large moves up through a sloping edge to a committing dead point and casual top out.  An excellent climb."
Ataturk,5,overhanging,traverse,"Sit start, hands matched on a large flake undercling.  Traverse along small crimps using toe hooks and a small heel hook.  Throw around the corner, and finish straight up (v2-ish).  (also the downclimb)"
Bridalveil Pogo,7,overhanging,dyno,Unnamed V7 in the SuperTopo book aka Bridalveil Pogo. It is located to the left of Wall to Wall Carpet.  Sit start at the good jug. Climb up into the giant undercling and then make a big move to a right hand sloper. Climb left to the jug and top out. Gym-like moves.  youtu.be/1P9qvL6QQoc
The Seam,11,overhanging,traverse,This route is on the same boulder as Bridalveil pogo just to the left. Start on two jugs on the bottom of the seam and work your way right them up.
The Presidential,0,vertical,face,Pick a spot along the face and climb straight up. You can make it harder or easier on yourself.
Presidential Traverse,0,vertical,traverse,Make the long trip along the featured slab in either direction.
Hueco Wall,5,overhanging,face,Up the huecos on the downhill face of the lowest boulder in this area!
Unnamed Undercling Problem,1,vertical,dyno,"Listed as unnamed V1 in the book, this problem deserves a lot more credit than it gets. To start, work up into a pair of nice high underclings. Work the feet up, the huck for a big shelf, then readjust and go to the top.  There are several other variations possible by starting further right, all worthwhile."
Cave Direct,3,overhanging,dyno,"Jump start to a friendly, rounded jug. Climb straight up"
The Sloth,3,overhanging,steep,"On the left side of the overhang, there is a obvious slanting rail.  Start on the ground, and find the best foothold.  Work your hands up the slanting rail until you reach the top of it.  Make a big reach up to one of the holds at the top of the boulder.  Match and mantle.    A great problem on a classic boulder.  Enjoy!"
Bottomless Lieback Corner,0,vertical,crack,Left angling dihedral with a crack. Fun easy moves.
The Pedestal,0,vertical,crack,"Climb the right side of the pedestal below Grant's Crack, and right of Knob Walk."
Glass Dike,0,vertical,face,"Face just right of Face 2. Many variations exist. This was always the route I felt most comfortable downclimbing from the top of the routes here, but YMMV."
Hand Rail,0,vertical,crack,Look for the flake hanging over an alcove a bit to the right of the 5.0 crack (called Bobcat Crack here on MP).
Face,2,vertical,face,Climb the face between Alcove Crack and the next crack the right.
Swan Slab Traverse,2,vertical,traverse,Start at Chockblock Chimney and traverse to Grants Crack (5.9). Stay low.    V4 variation is done by not using the vertical crack near the start.    Can be extended at least as far as Diagonal Crack (5.6) for a super-fun V2-V4 traverse well over 200 feet long.
Friction Face 3,2,slab,technical,"Friction face between Pin Scar Crack and the tree to the right. Very thin and airy moves, but fun."
Grease Foot,3,slab,technical,"Just around the corner left of West Slabs, look for the left-slanting foot ramp near the ground. Go up from there. Descend by downclimbing the lower part of West Slab."
Westbay Lieback,3,slab,crack,Left of Grease Foot and Lieback.    Work the left-facing fold. Classic!
High Face,3,vertical,technical,Climb the face to the right of the 5.8 crack. Crux is up high with balancey moves.
Barton Problem,4,vertical,face,Difficult face with variations. Climbs past a vague right-slanting seam/dike. Joins the Westbay Lieback up high. Variations out left.
Snowman,4,vertical,technical,"Thin edging up to the right side of the flake on Slanting Crack. Thin moves up a bit high, but very fun."
Garageman,5,vertical,technical,"Just right of Slanting Crack. Thin edging up to small knobs then traverse left to the bottom of the triangular flake on Slanting Crack. Fun, thin moves up high."
Turtle,6,vertical,face,Climb the on the prow to the right of High Face. Look for the turtle-shaped scoop in the rock. The crux involves a tricky high step.
The Abstrusion,4,vertical,technical,"This is an awesome problem on the B-1 Boulder, found just a couple feet to the left of the Slopster. It features some highly unconventional moves for a boulder problem and is an enjoyable puzzle to solve.    Start with a good undercling and sidepull at head height. Climb past the large right-facing block and top out to the right. The first couple moves are thuggish, but after that it takes more brains than brawn."
Cave Problem,4,overhanging,steep,"This problem climbs up from the middle of the big obvious cave on the west side of the B-1 Boulder. The Slopster is located a few feet to the left, and the start of the Sentinel Traverse is to the right.    Start with a left hand jug and right hand finger pocket under the roof. Make a powerful move to a jug at the lip. Then work side-pulls out left until your standing above the roof. Topping out might be a bit reachy for short people."
Sentinel Traverse,6,overhanging,traverse,Start sitting at the left side of the face with opposing sidepulls. Traverse 25 ft. right to a drop-off at a good jug.
The Slopster,6,vertical,face,Start sitting on the boulder at the base. Climb up and slightly right through sloping jugs. Top out can be a little scary.
Flake Out,7,vertical,technical,"Start on high crimps. If you can get off the ground and get your right foot high, then you're in business. Do a weird right hand gaston left hand undercling match and hit the juggy rail. Climb straight up the mossy but easier face."
No Holds Bard,7,overhanging,face,Start on angled flake making some moves out right and back left to angled rail and some exciting finish moves to to an intermediate crimp before you top out.
Slapshot,8,overhanging,face,Stand start and climb the seam straight up.
Spanish Fly,6,vertical,face,Stand start on the right side of the boulder with right hand on arete and left on crimp. Make moves trending up and left to top the boulder out. Scope the down-climb first.
The Octagon,6,overhanging,face,Start on high crimps and climb straight up past a sloping rail to the top.
The Hexcentric,7,overhanging,face,Start on high crimps and go straight up. Sit start is still V7. Requires a pretty good right arm (or left arm) lock off.
Did it Up,4,vertical,traverse,"Start on sloping, angled crimpers. Climb up to awkward hold and traverse right with some balancey moves to a gastone. Footwork intensive."
So Good,5,overhanging,face,Start on a big undercling at head height. Go right and up through edges and slopers.
Biddles Traverse,6,overhanging,traverse,"Start on a side pull, or farther right, and traverse to and up the chimney!"
The King,6,overhanging,mantle,Start with a good left hand sidepull. Climb leftwards along the lip to a mantel at the apex. Still V7 if you escape early onto the slab. More like a route.
Behave,8,overhanging,dyno,"Jump start to the obvious crimp rail above head height in the middle of the wall underneath The King, then make hard moves up through a series of crimps until linking with the left or right exit of The King. Padstacking or other means of skipping the jump start are a big no-no."
Get It Up,3,vertical,face,A high ball climb up the rock face with committing moves in between good holds.
What's Next,3,vertical,technical,Climb the obvious arete on the Trail Boulder from a stand start.
The Bogart Traverse,5,overhanging,traverse,Start as for What's Next but traverse right on good holds under the lip.  Round the corner on slopers and then finish with an easy mantel.
Fish Head,7,overhanging,face,Climb the blunt arete from a sit start.
Once Upon a Time,3,vertical,technical,Climb the Dihedral from a stand start.
The  Diamond Left,6,overhanging,dyno,Sit start matched on slanting rail. Cross and make big throw out left to jug. Heel hook to reach high crimp and one more move to the jug lip.
The Diamond,8,overhanging,steep,Sit start. Cross to the crimp. Make a big move out left to an angled jug rail. Climb straight up following the arete finishing on the apex.
The Changing Corners,8,vertical,technical,Climb the finned arete from a stand start.
The Shadow Warrior,12,overhanging,mantle,Start standing with good holds below the faint corner. Climb out to gold holds under the prow and then mantel.
James Memorial Problem,3,overhanging,technical,"To find this boulder stand at The Diamond (the problem) and walk straight uphill (S by SE), directly away from the Diamond boulder. *Don't walk to the southwest (past Shadow Warrior) like the directional arrow in the Supertopo shows*    After a few hundred feet the James Memorial/Millionth Try boulder will come into view. The long, curving arete on the right side will be the most striking feature. This arete is the James Memorial Problem.    Sit start with a high grip and then pinch and slap your way up the arete, using a crimp on the face to the right at one point. The landing is good for the first half and then becomes a slanted hillside for the topout. Luckily the climbing also becomes easier in the upper portion."
Cedar Eater,5,overhanging,crack,"Great rock, secluded location, and interesting movement make this an all-around amazing roof crack. 30 feet of heel-toe-camming, double-fist-stacking goodness. There is no defined crux as it is all sustained inversion climbing. If you like offwidth, this is a must-do...and bring your abs of steel!    Most likely underwater early season.    This route was featured in Sender Films' First Ascent."
The English Have Arrived,1,overhanging,crack,"Found when trying to find Cedar Eater without the guidebook.     Splitter roof and right leaning crack. It's super thin hands all the way underneath, widening slightly to perfect hands to just-smaller-than-fists.    After scrubbing the inside of it ferociously, it proved to be an awesome little climb.    It was wet directly underneath the climb, getting our pads soaked, and this was in early August. I imagine before then, it may even by under the river."
Cedar Crack,5,overhanging,crack,"Cool hand-and-fist pumping out a roof crack with a surprise finish.    There's a small amount of kitty litter as you approach the end of the problem, where it simultaneously becomes more difficult."
Deliverance,8,overhanging,crack,"This roof crack is one of, if not THE, best crack problems in the Valley. The crack itself starts another 12' or so deeper from the start, as fists/wide hands, but some blocks on the floor prevent starting any further, as you would unavoidably dab. As it is, start at the obvious hand jam as deep as you could reasonably start, and continue out the thinning crack to a ringlock crux move or two, continuing into bomber fingerlocks and some face holds at the lip, and topout."
Nice Unnamed Crimp Problem,2,vertical,face,This is one of the better V2s in Yosemite and a nice warmup for trying Purple Barrel.  Start sitting as for Purple Barrel.  Move up and left on perfect crimps and top out using big holds on the arete.
Purple Barrel,8,overhanging,mantle,Sit start in the right facing corner. Make a few moves to the lip and mantel your way onto the slab.
Athletes Die Young,5,overhanging,dyno,"Low start - grab left hand edge around chest level on the arete, and a lower right hand hold. Make a short move to small incut crimp choose a foot and launch for a good hold below the lip.  Obvious and beautiful line!"
Heart Attack,6,overhanging,steep,Start on the undercling pinches to the right of Flatline. Climb up and into the big undercling and then left to a jug. This is where it joins Flatline. Finish straight up.
Torque,7,overhanging,crack,Start at the jug/pinch above your head. Either campus the first move or get your feet/body in awkward positions to do it. Climb up and right into the crack finish. Careful topping it.
Prowess,7,overhanging,face,"Starts on the torque boulder to the left of torque, sharing the same top moves as torque. Just up the hill from the massive boulder that has ""king air"" on it."
People Pleaser,0,vertical,face,Smaller boulder across path from LeConte Memorial.
Atlantis,5,overhanging,face,"Stand start. Make a few moves on slopers/crimps and then a big move to a good rail. The top-out can be harder than it looks. In the spring and summer, parts of the boulder including the landing can be underwater."
Good Vibrations,10,overhanging,dyno,"Great moves, yet height dependent problem.  Starts low on crimps, moving out right to establish on arete followed by a big move to jug to easy top-out over uneven landing zone."
On the Road,7,overhanging,steep,An awesome problem on good rock that's 30 seconds from the car. I'm surprised I haven't seen or heard more about this boulder.  The climb has an awkward start on a low square-cut hold with a boulder underneath. Make your way up on slopers/crimps and find a way to span the gap out left. From there to the top is tricky but not very difficult.  This problem gets a lot of sun.
"Doctor, Doctor",3,vertical,face,"Start as for Built to Destroy but climb up and left along the rail.  When it ends, move with difficulty to the lip."
Built to Destroy,4,vertical,face,Climb the obvious seam on the north face of the boulder from a sit start.
Rock Bottom (AKA the MSG Traverse),4,vertical,traverse,"This is a cool circumnavigation of the entire MSG boulder and a nice pumpy training problem.  It doesn't really matter where you start or which way you go -- the difficulty is always about the same.  But the Wilder guidebook suggests starting seated on the starting jug for Doctor Doctor and Built to Destroy, and that certainly seem like a fair place to begin.  This problem might well be kryptonite for the tall -- scrunchy feet and open hips required.  Also, brambles."
Rudolph was Adopted,6,vertical,face,"This was originally done as a lead with 2 pieces. There used to be a huge tree directly behind the boulder, making a fall quite treacherous. The tree is gone now, and it's a safe boulder problem."
U.F.O. II,7,vertical,technical,"Stand start and climb straight up the face using crimps, sidepulls, a crack, a high step, gaston, and whatever you need to get to the jug at 15 feet."
Double Decker,2,overhanging,mantle,"An excellent highball on the Medicine Man boulder. This is probably the best problem at Indian Creek in the easy-moderate range.    The original starting hold broke off a few years ago. You can still begin standing with a sidepull edge at around V3, or begin lower on the original hold which is a bit harder. The easiest and least contrived way to being is by just doing a short hop to the juggy rail. How you start is really inconsequential as the problems character lies in the upper section.    Climb up the corner on good jugs and edges for feet. Several feet up the good holds run out and you must reach up and left to an edge. Get your feet up over the steep section and then feel around over the top to find the some good holds and mantel over. The upper crux is probably only 5.10c (V0+), but comes a ways off the deck. Having stacked pads is nice.    I think the easiest way down is to downclimb the arete to the right. At the ledge, traverse left a short ways and then continue downclimbing. It's also possible to downclimb a very high corner on the south side of the boulder, or butt-scoot across a fallen tree branch which is resting on the north side of the boulder."
Atlas,5,overhanging,dyno,"Start seated matched on jug pinch. Set a right foot heel hook and smear with left foot. Huck for the lip and then mantle over. Sticking the throw is a great feeling! Supposedly the name comes from the position upon sticking the lip being akin to that of the Titan Atlas that bore the ""celestial sphere"" in Greek Mythology."
Ahwahnee Arete,4,overhanging,mantle,"This is maybe the best problem at the Ahwahnee Boulders. It is located on the large block right next to the parking lot, and is on the arete which faces away from the Ahwahnee. The horse trail passes right beneath it.    Start with fun dynamic moves slapping up the arete and opposing rail. Ten feet up you will reach the ""mouth"", and the mantel into it is assisted by a good face hold above. Above the mouth it climbs more like a free solo than a boulder problem. Step right to a good dish on the slab and then climb straight up on small but ""crimpable"" edges. These moves are about 5.8 R/X. Don't attempt to topout if it has rained recently and it looks like the moss is wet.    Downclimb the opposite side of the boulder to get off."
Pugilist,9,overhanging,steep,"Start on low incut crimp-jugs in the cave, moving out right to the arete and then up onto an easy slab topout. There is a lot of different beta for the entire sequence from the start to the slab, so I won't go into detail there."
The Lookout Tower,4,vertical,face,"Start in depression on right side of arete, climb up 10 feet, turn left around the corner and make difficult moves over to left hand gaston and an undercling.  Another 15 feet of v1/v2 climbing to the top out jugs."
Splitter Bluebird,1,overhanging,crack,"Superb overhanging highball lieback crack.  As good as it gets.  Discovered and cleaned by Michael Rael Armas and gifted to Patrick Hodge who did the first ascent.   To get there, first make sure you are in the right dimension, there is a portal if necessary, or use DMT to enter the correct dimension. Head up into the Talus behind Montezumas Revenge and trend up and left (west) for about 10 minutes.  It's a maze up there but hunt around and you will find it."
Silent Spotter,6,vertical,face,Start two hands on the finger jug rail on the left side of the face at head height.  Climb up and left using holds on the face and bumping your right hand up the arete. Top-out on the apex of the boulder (be careful not to dab on the boulder to your left)!
The Fridge,5,overhanging,traverse,"Start sitting on the right arete of the boulder and traverse up and left, past two incut crimp rails.  Top out left of the rails."
No Fur,3,overhanging,technical,No Fur is a classic moderate sloper problem that can succumb to a variety of technical and powerful solutions.
Rubik's Arete,4,overhanging,mantle,"Start standing with left hand on the arete and right hand on an edge.  Climb up the arete, then make a difficult mantle onto the face."
Pride,7,overhanging,dyno,"Balance up the sloping foot-ledge to a decent side pull, and a loooong reach to another decent crimp. Paste your feet a bit higher and jump to the lip. You may want to walk up the back, just to confirm that there really aren't any other holds to grab."
Crystal Direct,3,vertical,face,Start on crystal and climb straight up.
Intruders Welcome,4,vertical,face,Start start on crimps above the scoop. Climb straight up.
Great White,1,vertical,face,Start on high angled slopers.  Head left to holds and then up and right to the top.
Orion,8,overhanging,steep,"A classic problem tucked into the woods off the Horse Trail. Slightly overhanging crimping the entire way, with the moves getting easier the higher up you go. AM shade.  The landing would be perfect, but unfortunately the tree that used to grow to the right of the problem fell over and is leaned up behind it, a little bit too close for comfort. You probably won't land on it, but it would suck if you did. At least you can use the stump to work the upper moves."
One boulder short of a picnic,3,overhanging,mantle,"Start with the two lower crimps (left and right) and your right foot up the rightmost step. Make your way up to the small rail, bit of a gaston to the left, reach the top an left arm mandle to climb up."
Steal Your Face,4,overhanging,mantle,"Park at the Woodyard (the actual woodyard, not the MSG boulder) in the big dirt pullout on the right side of the road with the long iron gate. This is about half a mile down past the El Cap meadow. Steal Your Face is the first problem you'll see on the left. It faces the old logging road.    Mantel into a scoop and get stemmed as high as you can on the right-trending ramp, then lunge up and right to a pinch/sidepull at the lip. The topout requires some groveling. Might be a good idea to clean off the top beforehand and scope out where the holds are up there.    Classic problem with varied moves and perfect landing. One of my favorite V4's in the Valley.    The unnamed ""V3"" just to the right is several grades harder than that. Don't know if something broke or it's just graded wrong in the book."
Wood Yard Arete,6,overhanging,technical,Climb the arete to the right of the large tree. Be careful topping out.
Yabo Face,11,vertical,face,"Start at head on height on 2 staggered crimps, and get to the long crimpy/slopey ledge 3 inches heigher. Use some trickery (or a big move) to gain the nice crimp a few feet up. It gets easier from there."
Yabo Roof,12,overhanging,dyno,"Start high in the nice undercling. From there, use some skill to bust up and right to a fun top out. Classic if you can climb this grade!"
Big Flapper,1,overhanging,face,Use jugs as handholds and smear for the feet.
"Stop, Climb, and Roll",2,vertical,face,Great hold for left hand close to the top of the boulder.
Rockaway Reach,2,overhanging,dyno,Start on left and do a dynamic move to the hold on the right.
Squirrel,6,vertical,face,A steep arete problem with powerful moves and some really cool holds. The crux revolves around getting to and moving off of the jug in the middle of the climb.
Generation Direct,7,vertical,face,"Start matched on positive rail 5 ft off the ground. Make moves following the seam. Half way up, transition right to the crack/arete feature and keep it together for positive holds at the top."
The Wave,3,vertical,technical,"A classic, tricky Yosemite arete with a mix of powerful and technical movement."
"Cindy (AKA ""Sydnie"")",10,overhanging,crack,"A tall, mossy problem that follows a vague overhanging crack feature with a mix of crimps and slopers.  Stand start with sloping crimps.  While the problem may at first appear damp and dirty, the major holds remain relatively clean.  (Though the top may need cleaning.)  My understanding is that this problem was originally top roped by Sean Myles, who had recently broken his leg.  Randy Puro may have done the first boulder ascent.  This problem is listed as ""Sydnie"" in both the Wilder and Reid bouldering guidebooks, but the consensus of opinion seems to be that it's named after a Cindy."
Dynamite Crack,0,vertical,crack,"Ok, so this isn't on the Cookie Cliff (actually it's over a mile away) but you start the approach from the base of the Cookie and I didn't want to make a whole new area for one 20ft crack so this seems like as good a place as any to list this climb.    Dynamite Crack is either a classic boulder problem, or a not-that-great and ridiculously short TR/lead - sort of like Circuit Breaker. It's got quite an approach for such a small amount of climbing. From the toe of the Cookie Cliff, follow the Old Cookie Road southwest and uphill towards Foresta. It's hard to believe that cars were driving on this thing just over 30 years ago, because at times the road is wickedly overgrown and not even visible. Some minor bushwhacking may be required which will suck with a pad on your back.    Within a few minutes you will pass a long, 35ft tall cliff on the right side of the road/trail. Near the right side, behind a big oak tree, is a nice 10a finger crack in a right facing corner. This is not Dynamite Crack, but you should stop to climb it anyways, since it's on the way. Due to it's height it's really more of a 5.10a boulder problem followed by a 5.6 free-solo to top out.    From here continue another mile up the Old Cookie Rd, eventually passing in altitude from the brushy scrub-oak typical of the Lower Merced, into more of a pine forest environment. When you reach a section where the asphalt road is seriously undercut with a large steel cable showing, and you have to traverse a narrow path, then you know you are starting to get close.    At a flat and open area with lots of tall pine trees, you can see the flat top of the boulder with Dynamite Crack a couple hundred feet off to the left (downhill) of the trail. Dynamite Crack is the obvious splitter on the southwest side of the boulder. The crux is the first 6 ft of finger stacks and thin hands. The upper bulge offers better handjam pods at a committing height."
"Walk, Don't Run (aka The Bouldering Arch)",0,vertical,crack,"This is a 5.10 boulder problem in the middle of the cliff, beneath an exceptionally blank and vertical section of wall that has no routes. The arch provides excellent endurance training and can be a good way to warm-up, or finish off a day of cragging.    Don't bring a pad for it, the approach will suck because you have to navigate between trees and bushes and stuff. You're never more than 5ft off the ground and the landing is flat dirt except for on the left side where some bay trees grow out from the base of the wall and could potentially do bad things to your ankles if you fell on them... but a pad wouldn't help for that anyways.    You can do the whole thing as an under-cling, or for most of it you can get various sizes of handjams in the crack. Either way you're sure to get yolked if you do enough laps in a row."
Heart Route (Free),10,slab,dyno,"First climbed in 1970 by Scott Davis and Chuck Kroger, the Heart Route follows an obvious line through the middle of El Cap's SW face. The free climbing follows most of the original route, with a few variations. The climbing is varied, with tedious slabs down low, and steep enduro pitches above the heart. The ""V10"" rating is for a dyno on the sixth pitch."
Spliter handcrack,0,slab,crack,"Thin hands to full hands at the top, negotiate the arete on the left and top out. A great place to learn hand jams close to the ground."
Wet Hug,0,vertical,face,"A true classic for any lazy sun bather who happens upon this Yosemite paradise. This short but sweet climb features easy crimps, jugs, and ledges. Zero protection and a dangerous fall into six inches of water and slippery stones, but well worth it.  Don't fall. Just don't."
High Voltage,2,slab,crack,"Slab problem until you reach the crack, then fun simple movements to an easy topout."
Power Failure,3,vertical,mantle,Powerful mantel problem. Start on the obvious jug on the roadside block. Scramble and balance is the name of the game.
Devil's Right Cheek,3,vertical,crack,"Would be a classic if it wasn't for the charred surface and bumpy landing. Climb the edge on the right of the crack, the left side is off. Layback moves, good side pulls, and lots of smearing. Start matched on the right facing crack and shoulder height.    See comments for beta video."
The Jet,2,vertical,dyno,"A cool small route with some big, dynamic moves."
Baseball,2,overhanging,face,"Climb the problem left of the diagonal crack. Start on obvious low holds, make move out right to slopey gastone and establish yourself in the undercling before making the moves to the top."
Crimpy V4,3,overhanging,face,"Located just right of the diagnol crack, this problem pretty much just doesn't use the big holds that the V1 uses.  Its pretty crimpy, but fun none-the-less."
Orange Buddha Face,4,overhanging,face,What's left of Orange Buddha Arete since the rock tilted in 2017.  Sit start ~V4/5 or stand start ~V2/3.
Grace Face,5,vertical,face,"Start on big diagonal rail and ascend using sloppers, crimps and pinches"
Arete Dream,5,overhanging,steep,Start low on a big pocket. Make some hard moves up the arete and left to the headwall using side pulls to gain the jug at the top.
Kiki's Big Adventure,6,overhanging,traverse,"Start low on Diagonal Ramp, traverse left into Grace Face and finish it out."
Orange Buddha Arete,7,overhanging,face,Climb depends on sand levels. Best when sand is high. when sand is low there is a jagged rock right behind you. Sit start on low holds and climb up the arete feature. This climb has several variations.
Belly Of The Buddha,10,overhanging,traverse,start right or Orange Buddha Arete on a LH fat pinch and RH incut crimp. Traverse/campus on decent holds with no feet to the start of Orange Buddha Arete and finish it
Bound by Tension,10,overhanging,face,"Climb the shield feature starting on the jug rail.  Here's a video prior to the boulder shifting, decreasing the grade from v11 to what is now v10."
Surf's Up,2,overhanging,dyno,"Start low on jugs and work straight up using the positive features while resisting the temptation to reach around left onto the arete. Make a big reach to the large, chalked block at the lip.  Skipping the intermediates and leaping straight for this hold seems to be considered ""Yuji's Dyno,"" and grabbing the arete to the left drops the grade and seems to be classified as ""Nudist Side Jug Haul."""
Yuji's Dyno,6,overhanging,dyno,Start on left hand ear-hold and right hand jug. High foot to a huck at the lip.
The Sandwich (The Buttwich),0,vertical,crack,Fun problem starting low on the south face of the Old Man Boulder. Climb up to your right with the finish wedged in the large crack in the rock. Can sit in the crack before the down climb.
High Tide Traverse,5,vertical,traverse,"Located in the corridor on the north facing side of the Old Man Boulder. Traverse right to left and/or left to right on the north face. For full value, traverse entirety of Old Man Boulder, i.e., south to west to north faces or vice versa (this would be significantly harder and increase the graded level)."
Standard Route,3,vertical,face,"Start low on marginal undercling or sidepull block. Move up to two good holds around face level, then keep going up."
Arete,5,overhanging,steep,"The line that ascends the left arete feature of the ""Are You Experienced?"" boulder. Start as low as sand levels permit and climb powerful moves up the arete to a tricky topout encounter. Definitely not a give me for the grade."
Smiley Face (Sit),6,overhanging,face,"sit start matched on the sloper rail or right hand on sloper rail with left hand on tiny crimp. Make move/s into the undercling flake and climb ""smiley face""."
Little Wing,7,vertical,face,Three or four tough moves from standing with an awkward topout.  V9 sit start.
Are You Experienced Traverse,10,overhanging,traverse,traverse from left to right. start on low jug shelf and top out on far right side of boulder (if facing it)
Manitou,11,overhanging,face,Just left of little wing
V1,1,vertical,face,"A fun line well worth the relatively short hike. Low jugs and pinches lead to a ""hidden"" crimp and long move to the top."
North Arete (Yabo),5,overhanging,steep,Sit start and wrestle up the fun low-ball arete/ prow. Might be tide dependent.
Midline Crisis,5,overhanging,dyno,"May not be accessible with high sand! Start on lower right jug, throw to the first in a series of tiny crimps along the middle crack, top out left."
Way of the Wah,8,overhanging,steep,Maybe the best problem when its not wet. Start on rail and bust a move out the roof on positive holds. Save energy for a tricky ending...
Old School,2,vertical,face,"Sit start on right-facing side pulls. Find feet out to the right. Slowly bump up a series of side pulls and a left hand pinch, eventually throw a committing left hand up to a good jug. From there the top out is straight forward."
Kenny's Arete,5,vertical,face,Stand start and climb the arete or sit start (V6)
High Rev Motor Sports,5,vertical,face,Start on the slopey jug and climb up the semi obvious line. The high stand start is V3
Crimps of Bel Air,6,vertical,face,"Start on the left side of the prow, get to the Arete and climb straight up the highball prow."
Backside Bouldering,0,vertical,face,A few variations have been done ranging from V0- to V1.
Shady Rock Traverse,2,vertical,traverse,"Start as far left of Small Man Complex as you can, and traverse all the way around to the right of Herpes Simplex. The hardest moves are moving around the corner between Slot Nose and Cotton Mouth. So much fun!"
Devil Baby Traverse,5,overhanging,traverse,"This problem traverses the entire overhanging left face of the Middle Muffin right to left, and ends in a demanding mantle move at the end."
The Sticky Green Traverse,6,overhanging,traverse,"Stand start on a good ""old"" V3(?) pocket problem on the right side of the face and do the first couple ""hard"" moves up the V3 then instead of topping it out traverse left all the way to the moss before the tree and then pull onto the slab to finish - classic slopers and pockets!"
Unknown,4,vertical,face,Sit start with a left hand undercling and right hand side pull. Go up using slopers. *Note: if you know the original name and grade of this problem please update this page*
Grotesque Old Woman Boulder,3,overhanging,mantle,Set start in small cave up to small pocket to mantle finish.
Oswald Cheese,2,overhanging,face,"On the uphill corner of the boulder, right of Gray Face. There's a picture of this on the cover of the 1995 edition to the guidebook. Fun, committing moves up high..."
The End,3,overhanging,dyno,"The burly ending to the ""Klinghoffer Traverse"". Stand start matched on the sloper pocket and dyno to the hueco jug. Move up to the horn and pinchable fin. From here grab a small crimp or undercling with your left hand and do a scary dyno to the obvious sloper jug. Might want to hang a pad from the tree in the landing zone!"
Klinghoffers Traverse,5,overhanging,traverse,This Traverse is one of the best in the bay. Starts on the far right (if facing the rock) and traverses uphill. Finish in the massive hueco by the tree or continue straight up for full value and a spicy topout.
Sloper Start,5,vertical,face,Sit start bottom right part of Arete. V5 start a few moves in.
Right Hand Man,7,overhanging,steep,This problem starts off under an overhang sit start; you're given a left-hand side pull nub and a right hand undercling. Suck it up and smack the SLOPEY arete with right hand. Takes lots of power to stick the first move (I found that the crux). Work your way up the slopey arete basically fighting to stay on until you reach the top and turn the corner.
Campus Creek,5,overhanging,dyno,Stand start and do a powerful campus move up to the ledge
El Chapo,5,overhanging,face,Start in a hueco and go up and right before breaking left onto jugs. Beware of loose holds
Ronald Dregon,11,overhanging,steep,Formerly the 'mega project.'  Sit start at the back of the cave.  head up and right towards the start of 'Swinger.'  Starts on one of the most giant jugs you have ever seen.  Head right into left facing jug feature and reach around.  This is the start of the crux.  Make three (or four) VERY hard moves to gain the start of 'Swinger.'  Top-out.  FA early '12    There is a large amount of advanced trickery involved with this problem due to the lack of feet.  Very cool and different for the area.
The Tufa,2,overhanging,steep,"Stand start on obvious overhead jugs, pull to pocket and topout through cave opening to your left.  One move and the only route out of the cave."
Aqua Velva,4,overhanging,steep,"Sit start on a good left hand two finger pocket and poor right hand pocket near the mouth of the cave and head up left on jugs to ""The Tufa"""
Stone On Bone,5,overhanging,dyno,"Stand start with huge left hand side jug and right crimper. Huge right hand throw to lip on arete. Toe hook the jug, bump left hand to crimp then bump to angled big rail. Throw right hand to sloper edge stick it hang and drop finish! Topouts go left or right for future first ascents!"
Skunkape Stem,5,vertical,technical,The dihedral start to Stretch Armstrong. Stem your way up to the big move on Stretch Armstrong.
Stretch Armstrong,5,vertical,dyno,"Face next to the tree.    Start with left hand crimp sidepull, right hand slopey bulge, reach the knob, dyno straight up to a hueco and top out next to the tree"
Poop-shoot Pirate,3,vertical,face,"Start down low on a prow, stand up to undercling, go to to a right side pull, reach high and pull yourself over the lip. Top out using huecos.    Make sure you stay on the prow - on your right is another, easier climb (Pirates Lookout, V1)"
Skunk Traverse,5,overhanging,traverse,"Start right of the Drunk as A Skunk, traverse left around the corner until your reach a crack"
Drunk as a Skunk,6,vertical,face,"Start in the scoop, go up the slopey rail on the right to a small crimp, then to a big side pull jug with the left, then top out the mossy roof."
Naked Nazi Arete,1,vertical,face,Sit start and climb the beautiful right hand arete! Super high quality sticky sandstone.
Nature Nazi direct,3,vertical,technical,"Stand start on two tiny crimps, gain a good foothold and gain the arete. Awesome one move wonder!"
Left Arete,3,vertical,technical,Left of Naked Nazi Arete is a compression problem that's easier than it looks.
FF Crack,4,vertical,crack,"Move right to left on the large split boulder. You'll likely come out cut, scratched, and bruised. A great time!"
Nature Nazi Traverse,4,overhanging,traverse,"Starts low and to the left on the shortest part of the boulder, make your way rightward along the sloping lip, move through the insecure crux bulge and top out at some good jugs just before the large tree. A long and burly line."
Unnamed eliminate,5,vertical,face,"Start on two tiny crimps in the middle of the face, pop up to some more and slap up to the hueco. If anyone knows if this has been done let me know. A crimp might have broken too."
Another traverse project,6,overhanging,traverse,Start as for naked Nazi arete but traverse left to the left arete problem and finish it.
Nature Nazi Traverse (Yabo),6,overhanging,traverse,Sit start in cave and traverse into the V4 variation.
Nature Nazi Arete,6,overhanging,technical,First arete you see when you walk up. More than 1 pad is nice because of a rocky landing.
Sloper traverse,7,overhanging,traverse,Absolutely heinous sloper slab traverse. Start about 15 feet right of the lieback flake and traverse left on the slopey arete on barely there slopers. Crux is the first couple of moves! After the first couple of moves you can gain the good undercling and topout on the lieback flake or continue higher on slopers the whole way (V??)
Avery Power Pull,8,overhanging,steep,Sit start to Caunt Power Pull.  Climbs very differently and really doesnt use the same movement.  One of the best of the grade at castle rock.
Santa Cruz Dude,3,overhanging,dyno,Dyno from crimps. Might be harder for shorter climbers.
Dark Side of the Moon,6,vertical,face,"about 60 feet downhill from Indian Rock, head down the path and sniff around until you find the nook with this route and Right Hand Indian Man (V6).  These two problems face downhill, but are not super difficult to locate.    ID this problem by the 5 shallow dishes on the face making a triangle.  Start with a right hand in a dish and left on a sloper, slap up with the right to the obvious moss-free section of the topout"
Asian Invasion,7,overhanging,mantle,"V7 if you start on the lowest holds possible. First move is the crux (somewhat contrived but fun), slap up some slopers on the right and mantle at the top. Apparently the right hand start hold broke somewhat recently making this problem a bit harder. Stand start is V4."
Static Pinch Traverse,8,overhanging,traverse,Do static pinch and traverse right staying low - ledge is off.
Static Reach Sit,9,overhanging,steep,Sit start low and left of static reach.
Lost Keys Traverse,6,overhanging,traverse,Super awesome traverse boulder problem!
Lost and Vicious,7,overhanging,traverse,"Start Lost Keys but traverse lower than the regular variation, drop down into the sit of vicious eliminate and finish that problem. V7 finishing on the non eliminate from the sit."
#swag,5,overhanging,steep,Start crouched under the prow with a low right ridepull and chest-high left sidepull. Slap out right to some bad slopers. Delicately transition into the big gaston and top out.
Lowie Throwie,5,overhanging,dyno,"Sit start on the 2 lowest obvious sloper holds, then throw to the next obvious hold, then an easy top out."
Thee Classic,4,overhanging,face,"In my opinion as good as any V3 you'll find anywhere and one of my all time favorite problems. Move through the large hueco in the middle of the face, make a long move to the cryptic sloper at the lip and try to figure out how to top out. Crux is the move after you hit the lip (kind of tall but the landing is good).    I've always felt the Classic is a bit sandbagged but that's the way castle rock is sometimes. There's a low start that goes at V4 as well."
Rabbit Hole,5,vertical,face,"Great problem with very strange landing zone.  Take care when doing the first few moves.  Starts on jugs on boulder adjacent to sharma arete boulder.  You should find the boulder problem behind the sharma arete in a small corridor closer to donkey dong arete (located on the main indian rock). Once familiar with the landing area, it is not as dangerous as it looks. Knee bar beta. Classic movement."
Sharma Arete,9,vertical,technical,Climb arete from standing start.  One of the best or perhaps the best.
Tafoni Baloney,4,vertical,face,"On the backside of the boulder. Start low on the side clings, work right to the underlings, then finish up left through the heucos and slopey top."
Big Boss Man,3,vertical,face,Start low and climb the obvious line via big moves on jugs and other good holds. Hard for the grade.
Hueco Volcano,8,overhanging,face,"Start with good right hand pinch, poor left hand crimp, poor left foot.  Slap left hand to a two finger pocket, right hand to a sloper. Bump left hand to another pocket, cross right hand. Climb straight up through the large pocket and top out on a volcano looking hold.  youtu.be/Hxl37W27HK4"
The Beak Traverse,3,overhanging,traverse,Left right traverse across the Beak formation ending in a V0 type mantle.
Garage door traverse,4,overhanging,traverse,Start on the right arete and traverse into garage door. Felt about V5 if you do the direct mantle. Probably NOT a first ascent. Might be easy for the grade (haven't done it in quite a while)
Magoo Traverse,1,overhanging,traverse,"Start on the right side of the arete described here as ""Bates Problem (SDS)"", and traverse all the way around the boulder to finish up Mr Magoo.    There are numerous good resting points, but this is a solid warm up, and can be much harder if desired by altering sequences."
When Magoo Flew (Dyno),7,overhanging,dyno,"Start with both hands on the low Mr. Magoo jug/dish. Dyno up and right to the blind slopey jug rail, then roll over and top out.  Note on Route Name/FA - lmk if there is an original and I'll change. When Magoo Flew (A ""famous"" Mr. Magoo movie) seems like a pretty good name in the meantime."
Bates Sit,9,vertical,technical,"This is the sit start to Bates Problem on the Magoo Boulder. Start with both hands on the low horn/edge near the tree, left foot on the tiny dish, right foot smeared almost on the tree. Hard first move to a small left hand edge, another hard move to the right hand above it. From there its Bates Problem with it's variations.   Note on Grade/Break - There was a hold breakage on the second hard move. The hold is bigger now but more of a sidepull - apparently made this harder, but V9 may have been a bit generous in the first place."
Magoo Slap,9,overhanging,dyno,Start on right hand undercling to left hand (poor) crimp then throw for the jug. Climb the arete to top .
Mrs. Magoo Traverse,3,overhanging,traverse,Start on the good side pull to the left of the small tree. Work right all the into the start of Mrs Magoo. Finish as normal for Mrs Magoo.
Hueco Slap,4,overhanging,dyno,Start sitting with the big jug and slap out to the arete.  Move up (staying on the same face) via a shallow pocket to the top.
Dog Dish Traverse Low,5,vertical,traverse,"Dog Dish Traverse, but stays low (going into the actual ""dog dish"" itself, then going around the into the giant hueco using some compression and marginal feet).  Goes around v5, but seems like a crucial sidepull crimp has worn down a bit making the move to the hueco harder to do."
The Slap direct,5,vertical,face,"Yabo start, move right hand to slopey pocket, avoid jug on the slope. Harder if you're short"
The Spoon,1,overhanging,mantle,"The Spoon has on=e directive.  How much can you scare yourself mantling 10 feet off the ground?  Many a beached whale have been spotted here, as solid hands lead to highball sketchyness to pull you over the top.    This route is on the downhill side of the boulder, check the photo."
Bates Arete,4,overhanging,steep,"The Bates Arete is one of the best problems of its grade in The Bay Area.  Starting low on the right side of the rock, and about 25 feet long, first traversing up a steep overhang complete with large jugs and slopers leaving the desire for a good rest.    The climb turns the corner from a good traverse into an uphill battle along a long solid arete where landings are bad.  A final mantle, and the problem is yours."
360 Degree Traverse,8,vertical,traverse,A complete traverse of the 360 Degree Boulder starting at any point in its circumference.
The Offwidth,0,vertical,crack,Start low and climb the offwidth without using the big jug on the V0. Technical
Flakes,3,vertical,face,lieback the right facing flakes straight up
Tree Problem,4,overhanging,face,"The Tree Problem sits on the uphill side of The Parking Lot Boulder, strangely enough no where near a tree.  Climbing is sustained, and many approaches can get you through the problem depending on your height and finger size.      Top out over the top after 8 or so hard moves and a good rest in the middle."
Yabo Roof,5,overhanging,steep,Yabo cave heads out of a cave downgradient to the left about 15 feet from the highest point on the rock. The route heads out of the deep (approx. 6 feet) cave and up the huecos to a committing mantle finish.     Pads are good for both the tree and for the ensuing fall from the mantle or the slap into the final hueco.
Coz Daddy,5,overhanging,steep,Start matched on lower rail or down deeper in the cave (won't effect the grade) climb right under bulge.  Do some weird moves to catch a  two or three finger pocket and hump the rock as you top out.
Deflowered,7,overhanging,dyno,Start on the holds for Deforestation and go big moves right and up to top out the Tree Problem.
The Quiver,7,vertical,face,Sit start as for the Tree Problem and finish on Deforestation. Much better than The original Tree Problem imo.
Deforestation,9,overhanging,dyno,Ascend small crimps on the steep wall to the left of the Tree Problem.  The crux is a hard throw off painful crimps which keep breaking due to people climbing too soon after rainstorms.  As a result the move keeps getting longer and harder.  Remember to wait at least 48 hours after storms before climbing this problem.
Collins problem,10,vertical,face,to the left of deforestation.  high start on two crimps and go straight up.
Blind Sided,6,overhanging,dyno,high awkward toss to blind jug with crazy swing!
Groundation,7,vertical,face,V6/7 stand start in head high left hand layback scoop and go up past hueco and seams to high jug top out! or V7/8 sit!!
Domino Eliminate,9,overhanging,dyno,"Start on good right side crimp not so good left crimp. Throw to crimp rail, match, then top out."
Waimea Wall,1,overhanging,dyno,"Reachy or dynamic face to ledge then downclimb a V0- r.Down and left of the top rope crack ""Farewell to Arms""."
Cave Roof,3,overhanging,steep,Start on good underclings. Move into the cave and find a way to turn around (or don't). Good toe and heel hooks will take you to a big move up to the nice ledge. Mantle.    All the necessary and good holds are nice quality. A good brushing first might be needed.
The Block,4,overhanging,steep,"Start low on the arete, move up out of the roof, and finish up the slopey arete."
North Shore aka Waimea Arete,5,overhanging,technical,"Stand or sit start on the arete left of ""Waimea Wall"" and slap and hook your way up over the slopey top out to a big ledge - then downclimb V0- r!"
Yabo,5,overhanging,technical,"High quality and rarely climbed. I started left hand low around the corner on the arete in a pocket and right hand crimp. Hard slapping and squeezing gets you up the blunt arete. Great classic Castle Rock slopers and squeezing.  A lower start seems possible, but at least a few grades harder. The old book gives this a V4, but felt at least V5+ even by Castle Rock standards."
Pyramid Crack,0,overhanging,crack,"This is the diagonal finger and hand crack.  The crux is at the very top, best not blow it.  Its pretty consistently the same difficulty throughout, actually."
Eco Terrorist,10,overhanging,steep,One of the most classic problems in the Bay.    Stand start in the hueco and make the first move to the lip. Bump up some slopers and finish in a solid jug.
Freakal Terrorist,10,overhanging,steep,Low ball with great compression moves. Might be reachy for the short people. Start Left hand on crimp and Right hand on sloper underneath the lip.  Heel hook is up for start move.  Originally called fecal terrorist but Im making an executive call for a renaming.  Im up for better suggestions though.
Egghead arete,8,slab,technical,Sit start and climb the Arete.
Biddles Gold,2,vertical,face,Exciting highball with fragile crimps and a mega jug topout. Really only gets and R waiting if you're not solid at the grade and the extra fragile rock. Has potential to be much harder/ impossible after some idiot breaks the holds from climbing too soon after rain!!
Biddles Platinum,5,overhanging,crack,"Sit start and climb the fist crack up to the top. Hand jams are not necessary if you get creative! Mid stand start is V4, high stand start is V3. Great find Clay!"
Copperhead Extension,6,overhanging,traverse,Start on the uphill side of the rock next to the approach trail and traverse right into the ending of Biddles Platinum. Topping out in the Scoop is an awkward V5 variation.
Blue Steel,7,overhanging,traverse,"Sit start on Biddles Platinum, but at the the diagonal jug traverse right into the V5 stand start over the rocks."
Fish face,5,overhanging,dyno,Dyno out right to a jug from slopers.
Hueco Arete,1,vertical,face,"The face facing the road, I wouldn't fall in case a car comes speeding by."
Roadkill arete,2,slab,traverse,Start as for the slab problems but traverse low to the left arete. Very similar to a comp style problem found in a gym! The higher traverse variation is V4
Roadkill slab,3,vertical,traverse,"Start on an undercling in front of the tree, and traverse left and up through tiny underclings to obvious small crimp rails up to the sloper lip. Another variation goes straight up over the tree and slightly left from the start into the regular variation."
Roadkill traverse,4,vertical,traverse,Start as far left as you can and traverse right to the big huecos to a big move to a hold that's not as good as you would like. Super good. More difficult and pumpy then expected.
The Slot,4,vertical,face,"Sit start on a sidepull hueco and a good crimp rail, move up to another, and move up the obvious line. V4? Could be easier."
Ripples,6,overhanging,dyno,"Start low on a left hand undercling/ right hand sidepull and dyno up to the jug. From there Traverse right to the slopey crimps on the face up to the Fontainebleau slopers on top. The stand start on the jugs is a V4, and starting low and right using compression to get to the jugs is a V7 and impossible unless you have the big wingspan required."
Finger crack project,10,overhanging,crack,Crazy hard finger crack! V10?
The Sloping Scoops,0,vertical,face,Start on the left side of the boulder on the hillsides and climb the slopey scoops. There are multiple starts to this problem.
Trailside direct,4,vertical,face,Start in front of the boulder and climb up to a high top out over the creek high off the deck. May need some cleaning and a landing zone that needs to be built for pads over the creek.
The Spire,0,vertical,face,"A nice warmup. Stand start in the pockets and climb straight up the highest part of the back of the ""spire"" formation of goat rock. V0 if you use all holds. V1 direct. Climbing on the anything other than the spire itself is off route."
Caveman,5,overhanging,steep,"Sit start in the back or the cave on a painted slopey edge with a thumb pocket with your feet above ground level of the cave and climb up through the ""sloth"" jug directly into the undercling feature. From here match the jug (V5+) or swing over to the cave entrance to top out (V5)"
Planet Caravan,6,vertical,technical,A great problem that is unfortunately crowded by another boulder making the crux not dabbing on the other boulder. Also very friction dependant. There are two sit starts the lower start makes the first move harder but doesn't up the grade of the problem. I recommend doing both starts as they both have awesome movement.
Scary Traverse project,5,overhanging,dyno,Start on the huge sidepull jug move up to the small crimp and traverse to the good hold. From here Dyno to the rail near the top and your free! Try not to fall in the death pit at the beginning!!
Upper Bouldering Cave,3,overhanging,steep,"Crux is at the top, stick the jug and your clean. safest part of the climb is the upside down start at the lip of the cave, after that the pads are helpful but there is a ledge below you. I blew the crux and wound up falling to the flat (but stood up!) and it hurt."
Right arete,4,vertical,technical,The right arete. Re-cleaned as of 10/5/19! Sit start on hollow crimps.
Alpine face,6,vertical,face,Straight up the middle of the face.
Poppin' a Squat,2,vertical,steep,"Sit start with both hands on nice jagged edge and make first move to side-pull/pinch on the right. Power up to the next right hand, and the rest is V0/V1 moves. Down climb or fight the poison oak to get off. Dangerous landing with uneven rocks below (route moves right of the start)."
The Deuce,2,vertical,traverse,"Standing start with both hands on a really obvious nice hold. Route goes left to a heel-hook on the ledge, traverses right across the slab, then goes up to the top-out. Careful of poison oak! Walk off the back of the boulder (downstream creek side) and fight the poison oak, or down-climb and jump to crash pad. Name comes from the deuce that someone dropped behind this boulder near the route (careful not to land in it). Route has been brushed and moss is gone from all holds and edges as of 5/13/19"
"psychedelic side, standard route",1,vertical,technical,"Start on the slippery pedestal with your hands on the two jugs, then right hands underclings the top of the circle, right foot bumps, left foot stems out to a good edge out to the left, left hand then reaches high out left for a rectangular knob. et voila!"
Jugs,1,overhanging,steep,"Climb up the slight overhang, find a big jug about two thirds of the way up. It's a bit like a side pull but facing straight into the wall."
Turtle Rock Traverse,5,overhanging,traverse,Turtle Rock Traverse is an eighty foot traverse starting at the northwest corner of the rock on an obvious head high flake.  Two cruxes and a twenty foot section of slopers to finish.  The landings are great with a couple of pads.  The top of the rock is off for the basic traverse and a harder low variation also exists.  Beautiful location - especially at sunset.
Wicked,8,overhanging,face,"Start down low, with hands matched on rail. Ascend rail feature and exit left over the bulge."
Scenic Cruise,4,overhanging,face,"The easiest line at Bay View. Starts low on obvious, big holds and climb up and left via the seem to a spicy top-out."
Liechen Detector,5,overhanging,face,Same start as for Scenic Cruise; after the first few moves move right past some blank rock to a right sloping shelf and make your way to the top.
Cynic Cruise,5,vertical,traverse,Start right of Truth Serum on the large hueco or slightly right of it and traverse left via some good holds to the start of Scenic Cruise and top out the boulder.
Bay View Crimp,12,overhanging,steep,Low sit start a few feet left of Scenic Cruise on a left side-pull and a right edge and go up some not so very distinct holds. The only chalk you may see on this is your own if you're feeling around or actually trying it.
The Camel Toe,4,overhanging,face,Nice and crimpy start with a high reach to the crux.
Splitter Crack,0,overhanging,crack,"The best splitter at Glen Canyon, though it can be face climbed. Crux is down low. Watch for poison oak as you top-out."
The Unnatural Act,3,overhanging,steep,"Start on the ramp/slab under the main roof. Climb up and then out right under and through the roof, pulling crux moves at the worst time to fall, and pulling through the lip to the right, up the east face to finish."
Double Rose,3,overhanging,traverse,"Start on the lower section of the rock where the pockets begin, and traverse your way around and up to the right.  Top out where the rock gets squared off on the edge.     Crux is getting yourself up the portion just below the top out."
Scary Overhang,5,overhanging,steep,Sweet pockets come after the first move then straight up over the slopey/crimpy highball top out!
Scotts Arete,5,overhanging,steep,"Stand start right of ""Scary Overhang"" on the arete - go up left side of arete from start - sit start is V6. Scotts Arete Direct is a V6 stand or V7 sit direct up crimps to jug on lip."
Wandering Arete,6,overhanging,steep,start as for scotts roof then angle/wander up left into scotts arete direct top out. V7 from the sit start.
Scotts Roof,7,overhanging,steep,Stand start on the far right side of the main face and crank up and over a small roof on small edges and top out high and right! - - or start the same but angle up left into the jug on the direct arete and top out for the Wandering Arete V6/7 variation!
Scary Overhang low start,7,overhanging,steep,One move wonder into the stand start. Possible sit start?
Tractor Pull,6,overhanging,face,"Sit start left hand pocket and right hand crimp pull big move to a crimp then lip straight up to lip and top out. Exiting early on left arete is a separate easier line called ""Pull Out""."
Grizzly Peak Traverse,8,overhanging,traverse,The weird slightly cooler cousin of Nat's.  Start matched on the crimp rail on the left slab. Make some strenuous moves turning the corner to a juggy undercling. From there pull a hard drop knee or low feet to grab another jug and get as much as you can back before pulling the second corner (crux). From there small hands and feet bring you slapping around the corner to a lukewarm beer and a V8 tick.    Great video can be found here: youtube.com/watch?v=MOa04wg…
"Grizzly Peak Traverse (Reverse) - ""The Floor is Poison""",8,overhanging,traverse,"Just like the OG, but in reverse. Start two hands up and around the finish of Grizzly Traverse and first make your way downhill on small holds and a first crux of sorting out how to hug the first corner you come to.  Then move through the overhung section to the second crux where you begin to head back up to the start of Grizzly traverse, only from there you will top out what is usually a v1 vert boulder.  A bit more satisfying than the OG since you get to pull over a lip and actually top out. Slightly harder than the OG, imo, with the downhill section to start."
The Ramp,4,overhanging,steep,"Climb the finish of Nat's Traverse, which is an overhangingsection of rock with near vertical feet just to the right ofthe low tree, and just to the left of the sparsly grippedoverhung section of Mortar Rock.  This also has tons ofchalk on it.    This route has about five different ways to be done, butbasically you climb up the overhang using pockeys, slopersand crimps to a shitty grip about 9 feet off the ground, andthen reach up and left to a cheesegrater for a hold, andfinish by grabbing onto a large jug over the roof.    This climb has been my nemesis since I've moved here, so Iguess it's time for me to find something harder to work on!"
Sunshine (sit),5,overhanging,steep,Sit start left hand low on huge vertical jug and right just below the left hand on another jug. Make a tough move to pocket and slap up the bulging arete. Top out straight up or traverse right along the lip. Has a nice variety of holds.
Black Plague,6,vertical,face,Climb the line left of The Ramp. Several eliminants.
Pipeline Traverse,6,overhanging,traverse,Sit start matched on the right side of the boulder near the exposed section of pipe. Traverse from right to left using small crimps on the face (the top lip of the boulder is off). Climb into the sit start of Girl's Problem and either finish straight up on Girl's Problem for full value (V6) or continue traversing to the left arete of the boulder (V5).
White Plague,7,vertical,face,Sit start to Black Plague on low right hand pinch and left hand crimp. Move up and left from the face riddled with chalk and rubber. A left hand pinch and delicate feet set up a right hand snatch to the good arete hold and then top 'er out!
Stan's Treverse,8,overhanging,traverse,"staN  Nat's   Stan's treverse (not traverse get it harhar oh boy) is the same as Nat's but right to left. sickness moves! just as classic as Nat's, fshiz, yo."
Slap Fight,7,overhanging,steep,"Start matched, low on the rail. Work the rail up and left to the arete. Round the arete and top out on the slab."
Nat's Traverse,8,overhanging,traverse,The best problem in the Bay Area hands down!  I can't believe it wasn't listed yet.  The obvious line starting from the corner as you come up the stairs...pulling the corner is the first crux...(the top rail is off)...then the bulge right after the tree is the next crux...it ends on the ramp and is about 30 feet long..
Impossible Wall,8,overhanging,face,"Pure bouldering, straight forward big pulls between OK holds. Used to have a tree below it that you could start standing on, now you need to stack pads for the original start or the low standing start is solid V9.    Start with the left on a sidepull with a good thumb at the top and the right on an edge. Make a long move up right to a small edge then hand foot match, you have to pull your thumb off and put youor foot where it was, and pull through to an OK pocket in the back of a depression. Top out slightly right, not as easy as you want it to be.    The lower start involves some sidepull and undercling moves to get to the high start."
Sunshine Eliminate,9,overhanging,face,"Eliminate problem that removes all of the good right side holds from sunshine. Pretty fun problem, once you learn how to ignore the tree.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC7n0Y6AAI4"
The Odyssey,9,overhanging,steep,This is a good problem with the full crux at the first move. The climbing will become more casual the higher up... if you know where the holds are. UPDATE (12/29/18): The original rail associated with the crux moves broke off during the fall of 2018. The rail is now a 1 inch side crimp. Re-sends after the broken hold is unknown. The line looks like V11-12 moves through the crux even with the stand start.
New Wave,9,overhanging,steep,"Right of the ramp, start on a high left undercling and either a sloper or a pocket and go up right into the chalky sloper V-corner then straight up. Sit start called the Kraken makes it V11, iirc."
Yellow Thumbs SDS,10,overhanging,steep,Same sit start as Full Fever and go into Yellow Thumbs.
Cherries,10,overhanging,traverse,Combination climb - Sunshine eliminate into black plaque via Nat's traverse.
Full Fever,10,overhanging,steep,Sit start into Fever.
Influenza,11,overhanging,traverse,Start on Nat's traverse and go into Patient Zero. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev0el99_8ug
Grace's Traverse,11,overhanging,traverse,Sit start on Sunshine Eliminate and traverse into Yellow Thumb - right exit.
The Odyssey Sit,11,overhanging,steep,This is the sit start to the Odyssey. Do a large move first move from the jug at the bottom of the wall to gain the bottom of the flake with the right. From here you can climb in to the original Odyssey start for the crux move (originally done this way by Randy) or you can use holds on the arete for a milder version.
"Don't Worry, Be Snappy",12,overhanging,steep,"Located right of the ramp and new wave, this is an independent line starting at THE obvious jug, to a crimp, to an upside down sloper undercling gnarliness, and on up and over."
Block Traverse,3,overhanging,traverse,"A great little traverse when the Pit starts to get you down. Can be an ankle breaker, so bring a pad."
Center Overhang (aka Pitfall),3,overhanging,steep,"This route ascends the lower overhung roof to the left of the chimney in the main bouldering area. It is located about 15 feet left of the main chimney.  Begin the climb by starting up the face just on the left side of the roof, and then pull your way up the main section of the overhang. The top of the rock is off until you get to the basketball- like jug to the middle-right of the roof.     There is a prominent sidepull about 10 feet off the ground, and the crux is getting a hand pulling from this sidepull to the basketball jug on the top.     Be careful not to hit the lower section of the rock if you bail in the crux, as this slabby first five feet twisted my ankle on one attempt of this route."
The Bubble,5,overhanging,face,"Climb up and right from the flake traverse. You'll see asmall hole about 2 feet up from the right side of the flake,and then a large jug looking thing 12 or so feet off theground. Hitting the jug is the crux, but you're still notdone yet! Hold on and find some feet as you use less thanideal holds to pull yourself over the edge.Be careful if you decide to fall, as the landing area issoft, but sometimes a little small for this climb. Logs,trees, and the first couple of feet of the rock itself areall potential hazards.A v6 variation called the bubble bypass exists skipping the bubble and going big for the incut."
Indian Rock Traverse,5,overhanging,traverse,"Start as low as you can on the main rock, pretty close to where the path forks and goes out of the park, or around the rock.  Go uphill, into the pit, and exit to the left of the roof problem.     There are several cruxes, and probably about 1,000 different variations to this route. The toughest section is probably bridging the gap near the cave, and the next 2 or 3 moves.      Height is misleading on this route:  Yes, you're only 5 feet off the ground, but the route itself is some 75 or so feet long! Go and go and go.  Topping out in the end should neither be scary nor require a crashpad.  If you've survived the rest of this route, you should be able to climb the final top out with one hand. Breaks are plentiful on this traverse, there a definitely a few sections where you wish there were a few more.     You can also reverse this route (starting at the bottom of the roof problem, instead of the top) and working downhill.  This way's a little tougher, and goes at about V7."
Embryonic Journey direct sit start,6,overhanging,steep,Sit start below the the V3 start. Quite difficult.
Bananas,6,overhanging,steep,Sit-start with double hands on flat shelf right of `The Seam.' Move up through good grips & the arête and press out to the juggy lip to finish on the upper slab.  youtube.com/watch?v=LYsZbl_…
The Seam,7,overhanging,steep,Sit start matched on the low crimp. Make a few moves to gain a right hand finger lock in the crack. Don't fall while topping out.
White Men Can Jump,9,overhanging,dyno,"A harder variation of White Men Can't Jump:  Launching from the same rail, go to the horn about 1.5 feet higher (and slightly to the left)."
Stone Face Slab,1,slab,traverse,"Start low on side pulls, traverse the ramp to the right trend and then up over the boulder on tiny razor crimps. Great warmup although it's really tough for the grade!"
The Thing,3,overhanging,steep,"Sit start on a jug rail, then move up the overhang with a few big moves on crimps.  Top out over the bulge without dabbing on the tree.    I would say this is the most obvious and appealing line on this side of the boulder."
The Great Stone Face,7,overhanging,steep,Definitely a Bay Area test piece.
Anger Management,11,overhanging,steep,End is the crux
Joaquin Murrieta,0,overhanging,crack,Fantastic sideways jams going up the crack with good slaby feet to a platform just below the top out with a view of the valley and the lovely oaks. Great for some laps at sunset.  Down climb the detached flake on your left and repeat.
Basalts Bypass,2,overhanging,steep,"Start low and compress your way up to the very top. Don't bail out left. variation finishes to the right of the fin, spooky!"
Fools Gold,4,vertical,technical,Low start to Western Gold on tiny edges
The Pit,4,overhanging,mantle,Start on the obvious two good opposing edges and do a long dynamic move to a small edge. From here move up the obvious but somewhat cryptic holds to the shelf and mantle to the top. Don't fall after the first couple of moves theres a man sized hole right in the landing zone under the mantle on the shelf.
Bushwhackers Roof,8,overhanging,traverse,Start the same as the direct line and Traverse to the left to top out.
Bushwacker Direct Low,9,overhanging,steep,start matched on sloper and move right to jug and head up the arete.  Left kneepad helps.
Doe Library Traverse,7,overhanging,traverse,"This problem heads horizontally along the north facing corner system on the East (far uphill) part of the Doe Library, which is right in the middle of campus.   The route starts on the left end of a system of outside and inside corners, at a point where a large straight wall full of pockets of windows ends, and a small foot rail and vertical 3"" left blocked corner picks up, about 6' from the first outside corner, along a system of large 2' tall granite blocks.      Traverse left to right all along the foot rail, using surprisingly balancy motions to move from the initial start around the first outside corner, into a corner window, across a seemingly tough blank face, into another double outside corner / single inside corner move, around an easy corner, JUMP over the double doorway gap, around a few more corners to a tougher gap run / jump to a window well, and then traverse into a final higher ledge inside corner to a VERY dynamic slap to the final outside corner.    This route is a stout v2 to the final move, which is a REALLY hard desperate balancy run / slap to a fairly good outside corner on the upper edges, which is probably v7. The entire route can be done in regular shoes, but climbing shoes are probably better for the final section, if you're willing... Every move can be done individually, and most are v2 on their own.      There are rules though, which are purely for maximizing your entertainment:     1) All horizontal edges and ledges are OFF for hands. This includes the good hands in the starting outside corner, and the window sill in the second inside corner.     2) The double door is OFF. Jump, and watch out for those nasty doorstops.    3) Don't break the window in the second window sill move.  Berkeley campus police would be very annoyed.    4) Stay on the upper section (meaning unpainted granite approx 2' off the ground) for the final move if you're going to do the crux.  Going to the lower (2"" from the ground) section is yet another (very fun!) V2 move.    One of the best things about this route is that you can climb it at ANY time of the day / night.  There are two lights that you're going to traverse around which will keep all the moves nice and visible any time of the night.  I think the first time I played on this I was fairly tipsy at about 1:30am."
Safeway Traverse,0,vertical,traverse,"If Mission Cliffs is closed because of Covid and you’re on lock down, this wall is your escape. Keep them hands strong while staying safe.  Wall “discovered” in 2020."
Cutter,3,slab,mantle,Start on two good crimps and campus up to worse crimps. Eventually mantle on a ledge and your done.
Best of the Bay,6,overhanging,steep,Start at the obvious roof that may or may not be at head height depending on the sand.  Make thuggy moves with a tricky heel hook up to a jump-off jug.
The Abalone,2,overhanging,traverse,"Sit start on the far left side of the boulder and traverse right staying low. Finish either straight up after traverseing to the obvious jug or turn the corner with a big but easy move to a good hold. Stellar rock quality, Tide dependant. You may have to brush the sand off the holds."
The Ocean Floor,3,vertical,face,Start on the slab and lieback the obvious diagonal snake like pinchable overhanging jug rails. Drop off holds are obvious.
Intruding Dyke,5,overhanging,steep,Highball up the left side of the overhanging cove. Start low/standing/sitting depending on the sand level on the diagonal rail and climb over the big roof of the cove. V7 if you climb the right side of the roof.
Scary Roof project,8,overhanging,steep,Start sitting under the apex of the roof and climb up to the top without dropping off
Hidden Cove Project,9,overhanging,steep,"Start as for Intruding Dyke V7 variation, but angle up and right to the apex of the roof. Don't fall on the slab! Like all the other problems this is best and safest at a high sand level."
Sunset Solo,0,slab,face,The opening moves are the Crux but the middle section is tricky. The top section of the problem is airy and fun. Also the down climb! Best not to blow it while climbing up or down.
Snake charmer,3,overhanging,steep,Sit start and climb up the pinchable holds and drop off when you feel like it
The ladder (right finish),4,overhanging,dyno,Start standing or sitting on pinchable jug rails depending on sand height and climb straight up to a hang drop on jug rails. Not worth topping out in my opinion. Height varies due to sand level I've seen it anywhere from 15 to 20 feet tall at the very highest. 20 is unlikely and probably an overestimate unless the sand Is at it's lowest. Way more challenging than it looks. Dynamic movement with big throws to cool holds with specific beta. Sit start down and right with feet on the slab and traversing into the problem is a V5
The Wave Traverse,4,overhanging,traverse,Traverse The Wave from the far left all way way to the arete.    Turn the arete and climb the easy honeycombs to the top.    Guidebook says V2.. yeah I'm gonna say it was way harder than that.
The Ladder (left finish),5,overhanging,traverse,"Start standing or sitting depending on sand level left of the right finish problem on the lowest holds posible, move up through the big holds with a few slightly harder really fun dynamic moves to the same drop off holds, but a few feet to the left. The start holds are down and left from the right finish problem and goes straight up. There is a another sit start variation to the right starting with your feet on the slab and traversing low into the same finish. Project: traverse low and drop down into sit start."
Bathe traverse,2,overhanging,traverse,Traverse from left to right. Use some graceful climbing and try not to bust the thin stone or mud on the right side
Cliff House Traverse,3,overhanging,traverse,Another decent problem. Traverse main face from either direction and finish wherever you want. Finishing on happy ending makes it a lot harder.
Happy Ending,5,overhanging,technical,Sit start and slap up the arete feature until you reach a giant sketchy looking sidepull and stem to the back wall. Decent if you can catch it dry.
Dynamite Cave,4,overhanging,traverse,Stand start lower left next to bad fall zone and traverse up right into the semi highball Dynamite Crack to top out. ~Dangerous.
Screw Cap,2,overhanging,steep,Screw Cap is a 20' boulder problem that climbs the steep detached block left of the route Corkscrew. It traverses upward on a left to right trajectory on generally good holds.
Shralp Arete,1,vertical,face,Main arete sit start.
Sprak V2,2,overhanging,face,Face right of main arete over rocky landing.
Shralp,4,overhanging,steep,Steepest hardest problem on Table Sprak Boulder.
Fisk Mill Traverse,2,vertical,traverse,Start at the bottom right and work your way left. This is a long strenuous problem. Thankfully there are enough rests along the way that you should be able to get throught the problem with only a few rough spots.
Jugular,1,overhanging,face,"This route ascends the second most arete to the right on the wall, which is just left of the first cave.      Climb up a juggy climb with hidden but excellent surprises on the way, as you ascend to a top out that's quite high, but completely secure.     Enjoy!"
Vise Grip,3,vertical,dyno,Start on the lower rail and work your way up to the large nose. Grab it tight and work your feet up until you can throw to the top.
The Shroom,4,overhanging,mantle,"Start left, around the corner of Vise Grip, on a mono pocket and a good crimp. Use the 2 good underclings in the scoop and a high, left 2 finger pocket. Figure out the way to the sloper lip with some funky feet, and then do a spooky mantel onto the blank topout. A little heady"
Waterfall Crack,4,overhanging,crack,Sit start the splitter and go up. Avoid the ledge and follow the crack to the end to make it more challenging. This one will shred your hands so tape up unless you can get it in several tries unless you want scars.
Uplifted,6,overhanging,dyno,Sit start with a one/two finger pocket and undercling and move up the obvious prow to a huge Dyno to good holds.
Johnny Cash,5,overhanging,face,Sit start with a left handful and a right hand sloper above your head. Move up and right along the obvious line. Stellar sandstone.
Johnny Cash Dyno,7,overhanging,dyno,Start as for Johnny Cash but Dyno from the volume hold to the jug! The sloper pocket is off. Easier if you're tall
Stoney Arete,0,vertical,face,The obvious left arete over a bad landing/ water so don't fall! Awesome experience climbing over the swell like that to say the least!
Tufatafoni Traverse,4,overhanging,traverse,Start on a large tafoni knob under the arete and work right along a crack. Go around the corner and start using the cool tufa type holds that give this problem its name.
Traverse,1,overhanging,traverse,Start on the low ledge and traverse left. You can start on the jug to the right and add a grade or two.    As good as it gets for a lowball traverse.
Mantle 101,2,overhanging,mantle,"Start on the good jug in the roof, make a big move up left, grab the lip and mantle."
The Slap,5,overhanging,steep,"Stand up into an undercling and sidepull, move up then right."
Don't Stand So Close to Me,5,overhanging,traverse,Awesome highball up the left face over the ramp and tidepool landing! Start by pinching a chip on the arete with your right hand and traverse left up to good holds on the left side of the boulder and do a big move to the juggy shelf. Don't fall after the next move! Big moves on good holds over a scary landing zone. Bring an extendo brush.
Triceratops,4,overhanging,steep,Sit start on the underclings and move up the incredible prow.
Caveman,5,overhanging,steep,Start on the same underclings as Triceratops. Move directly across the roof using some funky toe hooks/cams and exit right.     Please correct the name if wrong. Can't find it referenced anywhere.
Sabertooth,4,overhanging,steep,Climb the arete
The Wave,2,vertical,face,The Wave goes up the rolling face of sandstone directly to the left of the wave's arete. Start at the undercling at waist level and make big moves up to the blob-like jug. Pull a crazy side-pull move to reach the top.  Be careful on the arete! The stone is very delicate.
Swell,2,vertical,face,Climb the flakes about 5 feet left of The Wave. Grab the jug at the top and go for it!
Brainwave,4,vertical,face,Sit start on the shelf and climb straight up and slightly left to the brain hold. The Crux is finding the hidden crimps on the seam in order to get the brain. Nice grippy holds that feel sharp after climbing for a while.
Gerstle Cove Roof,4,overhanging,steep,Start as deep in the cave as you can. Move out the roof and up the flake on the face.     Great roof and face climbing.
Emerald Urchin,5,overhanging,steep,Start as deep as you can and come straight out and up the face.
V0,0,vertical,face,Nice warm up.
Blockhead,3,overhanging,steep,"One of the most amazing boulder problems I have ever done. An absolute classic through and through. Start on pockets on the face, move up into the corner, then over the big roof."
Barnacle Bill,4,vertical,crack,Start on the pockets and go straight up. Using the crack on the right at all seemed to make it significantly easier.
Mini Corner,0,overhanging,mantle,Sit start in mini corner climb up to the beginning of sloper lip and mantle.
Baked Potato traverse,3,vertical,traverse,Sit start on right side in the mini corner and climb up to and traverse the textured lip to the far left.
Baked Potato mantle,4,overhanging,mantle,Tough mantle on the middle of the boulder. Mantle the sloper lip! Aboutb10 feet left of the easy mantle on the V0 problem.
Ghost Dance,11,overhanging,face,Highball slightly overhanging face - possible to top rope from tree anchor.
Fort Rosstafarian,6,overhanging,face,"Start on a bulbous jug blackened by shoe rubber, navigating past an undercling, crimps, and two big moves to an easy top out 20' above the sandy landing. A high start at the crimps is possible with extendo-legs or a pad stack."
Living a Dream,6,overhanging,steep,"Stand start on overhanging side of the right arete as high up as you can reach on several pads.  Lower starts are different problems, but the ""normal"" stand start at high sand goes at about V7."
Rossta Dreams stand Living a Nightmare sit,7,overhanging,traverse,"the bomb dizzle fo shizzle my nizzle . . sit start ""fort rossta"" then traverse right into ""living a dream""!"
Living La Vida Loca,8,overhanging,steep,the original low arete sit start to living a dream.
Flying Monkey,9,overhanging,dyno,An eliminate of Fort Rossta. Climb up to the shelf and dyno to the ledge.
Grand Finale aka Relentless,10,overhanging,steep,the lowest possible sit start down and left of the start for living la vida loca - one of the most bad ass lines on the coast!
Call of the Wild,3,vertical,face,stand start on horizontal jug on right side of main face
Love and Hate,4,overhanging,technical,"Climb below the arete of Love starting on small hands and moving right to left, finishing into Hate (V2).The arete of Love is off.      It's tempting to try and move up in the middle, but there's no where to move up to!  This scrunchy problem will annoy, frustrate and cramp, but it's an excellent problem."
Hide,3,overhanging,traverse,Start on the obvious rail on the far right of the boulder. Traverse left along the crack and finish into Bunchgrass. The lip of the boulder is off.
Sun God (sit),7,overhanging,traverse,low left arete sit traverses right and up into face climbing topout.
Booger Finger,3,overhanging,traverse,Overhanging start to a traverse going right.
Favors Undertaking,2,vertical,technical,"Semi highball corner. Edges, footwork. You can exit early left, or go straight up."
Passage,3,overhanging,traverse,"Route is located on the north side (facing downhill) of the Upper Saddle Boulder. Start on the left side of the face and traverse to the right, staying low. The crux is moving up from a large pinch to the ""Big Horn"" located on the knife edge arete(Rump Roast). Moving up onto the north face early makes this problem an easy V2.    It is easily the best climb in the saddle boulder. Loads of heel hooks in the beginning section with bad food holds below the shelf, and becomes more over hang when at crux move to the Big Horn, then ease off on the arete.     Problem is in the shade all day!"
Saddle Sore,4,overhanging,steep,"Wedge yourself in under the center of the overhang on the North face of the lower Saddle Boulder. A few desperate moves getting out of the overhang and onto the blunt arete, then manage your pump while you pull through overhanging jugs to the top. Most people don't start this problem as a true sit start and there are tons of potential eliminates both left and right. Basically, this is the obvious, natural way to claw yourself out from under the overhang."
Bitch Ass Whiney Ho,6,vertical,traverse,Start on the Right side of the South face and traverse left through quickly diminishing jugs and onto some desperate razor sharp crimps. Pull around the arete and continue along the vertical face until the boulder runs out. Always stay low and off the top holds of the boulder.
Gimme My Forty Sucka,0,vertical,crack,Gimme My Forty Sucka is the obvious crack that ascends the East face of the Hidden Boulder. It follows a slightly diagonal seam that starts about 6 feet off the ground and climbs through good lockers and edges with good feet if you spend the time to look for them. The rock is some of the most solid around so not much to worry about there but it's still a good way to scare yourself.
Brass Monkey,2,vertical,technical,Climb the obvious highball arete left of Give Me my Forty Sucka. There is a sit start that adds a few moves but most people start on the obvious jugs.    Slap your way up the arete to the unnerving topout. Hidden crimps and a bit of moss at the top deteriorate the psyche when scratching your way over the lip of this one. A stack of pads is rarely wavered on this classic highball.
Urban Myth,2,vertical,traverse,Awesome left to right traverse on big slopers.    Easy to go up early on big holds before the right arête.    Try and stay low the entire way to the arête and finish with a boulder beneath you. Feels way harder this way but more fun.
Natural Disaster,3,vertical,face,"Starts about 8 feet left of the arete on the Hidden boulder.  Natural Disaster used to be a potential natural disaster in the making... the problem is pretty highball, and the crux is mostly figuring out the beta on the upper portion of the climb. However, the topout also used to be quite hollow and loose making for an uncontrollable potential disaster for an unsuspecting patron who just pulled down a little too hard.    That threat is gone now as the topout has purged itself leaving a large scar in it's wake. Natural Disaster now climbs pretty much strait up and tops out on the very left of this scar. A low start and some decent crimps set you up with questionable feet as you search for the last inconspicuous hold to get you over the top. The crux is definitely at the top still giving homage to the name ""Natural Disaster""."
The 40 oz Traverse,6,vertical,traverse,"Start just right and around the corner of ""gimme my forty sucka"" and traverse left around the arete and uphill in the middle of the boulder using all holds and ending by topping out on the last possible route. - Classic!"
Space Lord,0,slab,face,"On the west facing side of the Mother Boulder is a flat less than vertical face. There are many holds and ways one could go, but it's more or less strait up the center of the face. The crux is getting off the ground and established on the wall. The higher you climb the better the holds get until you're topping out on jugs. This makes the route popular for those who are looking to train their heads more than those looking to pull down hard. No moves harder than 5.9"
Mother Nature,1,vertical,face,"Mother Nature climbs up an astheticly pleasing arete on giant square cut holds, pockets and crimps with a thought provoking topout high above the dirt. Which has sent more than one climber, highly confident in climbing V1 boulder problems on a despirate retreat.     There is a sit start which adds a couple of very powerful, thin moves of V4 to the start for a more challanging approach."
Global Warning,3,overhanging,technical,"Sit start and pull your way up straddling the big arete on the Mother Boulder. Good crimps, edges and maybe even a heal scum bring you up this daunting route. Stay left out of the broken area that leads off right to easier ground and attack the top of the arete directly. A good three finger pocket rest can be found just before committing to the topout which is not as hard as it looks.     Alot of loose rock was cleaned from just below the top. Stay left on the true arete from this cleaned area for the original version or go right climbing through the cleaned area and exiting up big jugs at the top of Space Lord should you suddenly not feel up to it.     This is a highball route and the name is an indication of that. So watch out for that gigantic rock (earth) if you think you're going to fall from the top of this one."
Smoke Pot Row,4,vertical,technical,"If you like thin micro edging, this route is for you. Sit start and lieback/crimp your way up a right leaning rail like series of holds before exiting onto the thin face to the right. Continue across the short face on dime edges until you can reach up and slap your way around the rounded, nearly hold less corner to finish on the low angle side of Scotts Rock. Best to have this one totally wired if you're going to be attempting Scotts Traverse. You'll be doing it with a serious pump and it's heartbreaking to fall this far into the trip."
Scott's Traverse,9,overhanging,traverse,"Traverse the entire boulder starting on a small rounded rock pedestal left of Coulda been Jimi's. Drop down almost immediately and stay fairly low the entire way. Once you reach the crack (you should still be really low to the ground) pull through the semi short but stout crux and reach for some thank god jugs rounding the corner. It's not over yet as now you must drop back down to a series of moves up a right leaning ramp/rail and commit to the final 8 ft of micro crimps and blisteringly thin feet of Smoke Pot Row. A slightly ascending brutally thin and sustained V4 traverse with a rounded desperate slap fest exit on the South (low angle) side of the boulder. Best of luck!    There is a V7 variation that is mostly the same but takes the hardest moves in the Crux out. Follow the same traverse from the start, but at the crack (Jimmi's Butt Crack) climb up and use the rounded rail and better holds above to aid your scamper across the steep face before dropping back down to round the corner. You still gotta finish on Smoke Pot Row V4 though. Don't cheat yourself..."
Ashes in the Wake,7,overhanging,traverse,"Start on an obvious low two hand match on the far left edge of the boulder. Traverse the entire boulder to the right staying at least 6 inches to a foot below the jugs near the lip of the boulder. This seemingly holdless variation to the traverse requires finding all the small, often sharp or bleak holds and dialing in the sequence before sending this super sustained enduro test piece. A good route to work on  when taking a break from working the near by Scotts traverse as it's a short step down in difficulty, but not endruance. Named after a small fire swept through the area a day or two after the FA."
The Bulge,3,overhanging,dyno,Start on good edges and pull onto desperate sloapers and side pulls till you can make a frantic lunge for the rounded top. Short but stout.
Bloody Madness,3,overhanging,steep,Sit start just left of the center of the overhanging face - or: stand start= V2
Stoned Dangler,5,overhanging,traverse,"A pumpy traverse that starts to the far right side of the Boulder of Bloody Madness on an obvious two handed, chest height rail just around the corner. Drop down and begin a sequential and pumpy traverse which quickly rises up to an obvious rail and your first rest. Now gain access into the long horizontal crack system that splits the boulder and fight the pump all the way across the face until you end up on the large juggy moves on the far left side.     You can give up there or go for the glory by climbing up the juggy overhanging arete above to the top of the boulder for the real finish."
Wildside,4,overhanging,traverse,"Start on the Right arete of the Wildside boulder (where Underworld starts) and traverse up and across the face to the left on a wildly overhanging face full of crimps, pinches and jugs. Finish on the left side of the boulder by climbing up and over the lip."
Tidbit Traverse,4,vertical,traverse,"Traverse the boulder starting out on good jugs and decent feet. Pull around the arete where the route completely changes character to thin pinches and crimps with bad, not so obvious feet. Continue left until you are almost forced to top out by the rising incline of the hill. Don't cheat and step off the boulder too soon, a good crux is right near the end."
Sun Spot Traverse,6,overhanging,traverse,"Traverse the South wall of the Spotlight boulder from Left to Right ending when rounding the corner.     Begin on a two hand rail at a near sit start and start traversing to the right on slopers and pinches. Make sure to stay below the big rails and jugs for the V6 version pulling through on sequential pinches, slopers, and a few razor edges to a pumpy finish rounding the corner on jugs."
Boxcar Traverse,5,vertical,traverse,"Traverse the Boxcar Woody Boulder in a Clockwise direction starting on it's Left (south) side beginning on a perfect, flat two hand rail start.     Warm up on the easy V0 wall and turn the corner to a short slabby wall to warm up the feet. Next, drop down around the corner (watch out for the barbed wire fence) and continue traversing the wall. Staying low for a pumpy sustained V2+ on big loaf pinches and crimps or head up high for a more relaxed and less steep variation. Get a good rest on some nice jugs before turning the corner and fighting your way through the last 12 ft of pumpy, sequential crimps and edges (stay low for the V5 or go high to the rim for a V1 finish) before finally pulling around the last corner and back to the start.      You can customize the traverse to make it as hard or easy as you like but staying low the whole way is the original traverse.     When you get it wired, give yourself a challenge and see how many times you can make it around without falling off."
The Warm Up,0,slab,technical,There are many variations on this highball slab. Pretty good to warm up the mind and body.
Heavy Metal Traverse,4,overhanging,traverse,"Start on high shelf on the right side of the boulder and work your way left. From slopers, to crimpers, side clings to technical footwork, this route is a great project for those in the v3-v5 range.     Having 2 pads would be a safe bet, you're feet are under a slight overhang and your back is over another small boulder the whole route until nice juggy finish. Crux is moving from slopey section to final pinch before jug."
Unamed V3,3,overhanging,steep,Rad thuggy pulls between good holds to a spooky top out..
Hell Awaits,4,overhanging,face,Start from high holds and make a move up to some jugs. From here figure out how to get through the cryptic face sequence to better holds just below the lip. An easy top out awaits.    The low start from opposing side pulls is V7
S.H.P.,4,overhanging,face,"Start from high, sharp notch for the left hand (you may need to stack pads) and a sharp, lower side pull for the right. Move up the arete to a big move and then a jug ledge. Any easy top out lies above.    A little harder from a sit start."
Chocolat,6,overhanging,steep,Sit start the right arête and top out S.H.P.
Hellspawn,7,overhanging,steep,V7 low start with spread eagle compression up into Hell Awaits - original start FA=CS  V8 from sit start matched on low left hand layback FA=CB
Welcome to the Whine Country,8,overhanging,traverse,A left to right epic traverse starting left of Purgatory on obvious good holds and ending on Right Arete problem traversing all the way across the highball overhanging face.
Slick,4,vertical,face,Start on a left handed undercling and climb up small edges to the top w/ poor feet
Monkey See Monkey Do,0,vertical,face,Climb the arete between the west face and south face near the left end of the formation.    VARIATIONS   Monkey Poo 5.11a / V1: sit start.   Tango 5.10d / V1: halfway up hand traverse to the right and finish on arete above the big vertical crack.
Dreamweaver,0,vertical,face,"Start 1 foot to the right of the tree and climb straight up to the top, finishing just left of the double-bolt anchor."
Footloose,1,vertical,face,"Start 6 feet right of the tree at the base of the south face and climb straight up, finishing just right of the double-bolt anchor."
No Brain No Pain,3,vertical,crack,"Climb the face left of the main vertical crack on the south face. Harder (5.11c / V2) if you go straight up, easier (5.11b / V2) if you finish on the arete to the right.    VARIATION   No Pain No Gain 5.12a / V4: sit start."
Fancy Free,3,vertical,face,"Start just left of the arete at the right edge of the south face and diagonal up and left, avoiding the big ledge above and finishing on Footloose. Easier (5.11c / V2) if you climb straight up to the ledge."
Mossy Rock Traverse,4,overhanging,traverse,"Sit start at the right edge of the east face, stay low while traversing left to the west face, finish at the top. Various portions of the face can be traversed at an easier grade from left to right.    VARIATIONS   Free Will 5.12b / V5: traverse below the small ledge on the left end of the south face.   Booty 5.11d / V3: sit start left of arete at right edge of the south face, traverse right and finish on the arete on the right edge of the east face."
Muchacho,0,overhanging,steep,"Climb straight up the small overhang in the center of the west face, just right of the hand crack. Handholds above the crux overhang are good but footholds are thin. A short but fun lead!"
Señorita,0,vertical,face,"Climb the right-center of the south face, starting just right of a bulge (note: the rock to the right looks rotten and may be unsafe to climb)."
Señor,0,vertical,face,"Climb the left side of the south face, starting just right of the arete."
Señora,0,vertical,face,Climb the left-center face on the south face.
Hard Up,3,overhanging,steep,Sit start in center of overhanging west face.
The Hard-On Traverse,6,overhanging,traverse,Start the traverse on the right side of the face climbing the reverse of Hard Up and finish on Hard
Skullcracker,2,overhanging,mantle,"Starts to the left of ""The Specialist"".  Sit start to a small ledge work your way up into a mantle and top out."
Rock Scar,3,overhanging,face,Sit start on the good sloper on the far left of the boulder. Move right using the obvious holds. The crux is a big move or a bump sequence to a large jug. High feet is key for the crux.
Calambity,6,overhanging,steep,"Sit start on the large ""V"" shaped notch. Go straight up the face, using two crimps with decent thumb catches. All the huge jugs on ""Skullcracker"" are off. Get over the lip, and top out by following the arete."
Pelican Arete,0,vertical,face,"Climb the interesting and sustained right arete, without using the left arete.  Holds are more plentiful around the right side of the arete.  Sustained and intersting, this is an excellent warmup route for more advanced climbers, and a difficult yet doable first 5.10.     This route is often bouldered, though the crux is about 10' off the ground, so place your crashpad carefully!"
Killer Crack,2,vertical,crack,"To the right of ""Pelican Arete"" about halfway on the face. Follow the thin crack to the top."
Mid-Term,0,vertical,crack,"Starts near the right hand side follows the crack up. Corresponds with number 4 on the picture. Once you have this crack nailed move on to ""Final Exam""."
Sunset Traverse,2,vertical,traverse,This climb is on the back side of the left most rock as you approach Sunset Boulders. You start on the left side and traverse right. Great endurance problem.
Potato Chip Arete,3,vertical,face,Climb the arete to the right of the Potato Chip Face.  Don't miss the one-finger edge for your left hand.    Stand (V3) or sit (V4) start.
Chip Direct,3,vertical,crack,Start left hand on potato chip crimp with right hand side pull on mini arete. Use the crack and the second higher mini arete almost directly above the the first.
Wrist Slitter Traverse,3,overhanging,traverse,"This is the best problem we found at Twin Coves.    Starting 20' left and downhill from the beginning of Seagull arete you will find an overhung section that allows for a great bouldering traverse.  Start on the large jug in the slot, and move steadily uphill on the arete. Continue uphill with hands and feet on the arete and mantle out just before the large bulge around the corner from Seagull Arete.    The final moves are guaranteed to slit your wrist."
Not So Super Slab,0,slab,face,highball slab
Dragonslayer,3,vertical,face,Stand start face/arete.
Super Slab,6,slab,technical,Same sit start as Abalone in center of overhanging face at base of slab but go straight up onto slab to finish.
Abalone,7,overhanging,traverse,Sit start in center of overhanging face at base of slab. Traverse across sloper rail from right to left.
Super Abalone,8,overhanging,traverse,Start on far right side of overhanging face at base of slab.Traverse left past heinous slopers and toe/heel hooks into Abalone finish.
Bouncer,5,overhanging,steep,Obvious sit start.
Sand and Shadow on the Sea,0,vertical,face,"Fun route right above the crashing water, start right at the water and work your way up the very obvious sand jugs, they seem pretty solid, and work your way up the rock face to the top for a view of the ocean!"
The Coffer,6,overhanging,crack,"Crouch/sit start in middle of face on sidepull and gaston and follow crack to horizontal, then up and slightly left."
Pomo Roof,3,overhanging,steep,Climb over the roof on the right side of the cave
Pomo traverse,4,slab,traverse,Slabby traverse. Start right of the tree and traverse uphill on the slabby boulder staying low the whole way. Needs to be cleaned!
Mainline,5,overhanging,steep,Left side of cave left of Pomo roof and right of Ganesh
Ganesh,8,overhanging,dyno,"Really tough problem! High stand start. ""Impossible wall"" of Sonoma county?!? Start on two miserable slopey crimps, do a tough move out to a decent gaston, dyno to the sloper, and top out to the left"
Guadalupe rock traverse,4,overhanging,traverse,Start standing on a rock in front of the 5.3 route or on the far left side of the rock and traverse right to the right most route on the boulder and step off or traverse the rest of the rock. I haven't traversed the entire rock yet because I don't want to go swimming but I would guess it's at least a V5/6 and a first ascent. Good summertime activity.
Please Don't Break,1,overhanging,dyno,"Both hands start on a sloppy crimp , then it's a a fairly dynamic move to good sloper with the right hand, and finally a dyno to catch a good left hand crimp at the top and a top out.  Ideal climber height for this is ~5'7"". Tall enough to reach the sloper, but still has to jump for the top crimp.  Many variants of this climb can be done to make it easier, but be careful of rocks breaking off the top and if you use any holds not described."
Should've Brought Pads,2,overhanging,dyno,"Starts slightly overhung with both hands matched on a good ledge and with feet out to the left, then a right hand move to a great crimped, then heel hook the start hold with the left foot and move your left hand to a decent sloper above the right hand crimp. From here, there's a dynamic move to a great right hand pinch where you lose your feet and try not to lose your left hand, then you can follow an easy line of crimps to a top out."
Left Crack direct,0,vertical,crack,The obvious crack system on the left side of the rock (the left most crack). Climb the crack up to the flake with giant jugs up to the ledge where you can rest and climb over the really exposed super scary section on the flake (follow the flake to the left slightly) to an easy top out on jugs. Very reachy route at times. 5.11a direct variation without bailing out left!
Right Crack,0,vertical,crack,"The crack to the right of left crack. Climb the crack up to the giant jugs on the flake up to the ledge, and follow the flake to the left over the  super exposed small roof to a juggy topout. Super fun! The crux is two tiny crimps before a jug."
Diagonal traverse,0,overhanging,steep,Start under the overhang on two obvious jugs and climb up the arete and do the same finish as the other problems on the flake.
